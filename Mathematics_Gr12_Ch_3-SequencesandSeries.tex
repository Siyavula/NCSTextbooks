\chapter{Sequences and Series - Grade 12}
\label{mp:s}

\section{Introduction}
In this chapter we extend the arithmetic and quadratic sequences studied in earlier grades, to geometric sequences. We also look at series, which is the summing of the terms in a sequence.

\section{Arithmetic Sequences}
The simplest type of numerical sequence is an \textit{arithmetic sequence}. 

\Definition{Arithmetic Sequence}{An \textit{arithmetic} (or \textit{linear}) \textit{sequence} is a sequence of numbers in which each new term is calculated by \textbf{adding} a constant value to the previous term}

For example,
\nequ{1,2,3,4,5,6,\ldots}
is an arithmetic sequence because you add 1 to the current term to get the next term:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
first term:&1\\
second term:&2=1+1\\
third term:&3=2+1\\
$\vdots$&\\
$n^{\rm{th}}$ term:&$n=(n-1)+1$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\Activity{Common Difference}{Find the constant value that is added to get the following sequences and write out the next 5 terms.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{$2,6,10,14,18,22, \ldots$}
\item{$-5,-3,-1,1,3,\ldots$}
\item{$1,4,7,10,13,16,\ldots$}
\item{$-1,10,21,32,43,54,\ldots$}
\item{$3,0,-3,-6,-9,-12, \ldots$}
\end{enumerate}}

\subsection{General Equation for the $n^{th}$-term of an Arithmetic Sequence}

More formally, the number we start out with is called \textit{$a_1$} (the first term), and the difference between each successive term is denoted \textit{d}, called the \textit{common difference}.

The general arithmetic sequence looks like:
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_1 &=& a_1 \\
a_2 &=& a_1 + d \\
a_3 &=& a_2 + d = (a_1 + d) + d = a_1 + 2d \\
a_4 &=& a_3 + d = (a_1 + 2d) + d = a_1 + 3d \\
\ldots \\
a_n &=& a_1 + d \cdot (n - 1)
\end{eqnarray*}

Thus, the equation for the $n^{th}$-term will be:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mp:s:arithseq:2}
a_n = a_1 + d \cdot (n - 1)
\end{equation}
Given $a_1$ and the common difference, $d$, the entire set of numbers belonging to an arithmetic sequence can be generated.

\Definition{Arithmetic Sequence}{An \textit{arithmetic} (or \textit{linear}) \textit{sequence} is a sequence of numbers in which each new term is calculated by adding a constant value to the previous term:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:mp:s:arithseq:1}
a_n = a_{n-1} + d
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $a_n$ represents the new term, the $n^{th}$-term, that is calculated;
\item $a_{n-1}$ represents the previous term, the $(n-1)^{th}$-term;
\item $d$ represents some constant.
\end{itemize}
}

\Tip{Test for Arithmetic Sequences}{A simple test for an arithmetic sequence is to check that the difference between consecutive terms is constant:
\begin{equation}
a_2 - a_1 = a_3 - a_2 = a_n - a_{n-1} = d
\end{equation}
This is quite an important equation, and is the definitive test for an arithmetic sequence. If this condition does not hold, the sequence is not an arithmetic sequence.}


\Extension{Plotting a graph of terms in an arithmetic sequence}{Plotting a graph of the terms of
sequence sometimes helps in determining the type of sequence involved.
For an arithmetic sequence, plotting $a_n$ vs. $n$ results in:

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-0.4,-0.8)(8,7.6)
%\psgrid[gridcolor=gray]
\psset{yunit=0.75,xunit=0.75}
\psaxes[arrows=<->,dx=10,Dx=1,dy=10,Dy=1](1,0)(10,10)
\psdots(1,1)(2,2)(3,3)(4,4)(5,5)(6,6)(7,7)(8,8)

\multido{\n=1+1}{9}{\rput(0.65,\n){$a_{\n}$}}
\rput(5,-.75){Index, $n$}
\end{pspicture}
%\caption{When the terms of a linear sequence are plotted as a function of the index, a straight
%line is obtained.}
%\label{fig:mp:extra:linear}
\end{center}
%\end{figure}
%Therefore, we can see that for an arithmetic sequence, the plot of $a_n$ vs. $n$ yields a straight
%line. The gradient (or slope) of the graph represents the common difference, $d$, and the
%$y$-intercept (for $n=1$) represents the first term, $a_1$.
%If we are given the arithmetic sequence,
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%4; \: 6; \:8; \: 10; \: 12; \: \ldots
%\end{eqnarray*}
%and plot each of the terms vs. the corresponding index (subscript), we get a graph of a straight
%line.
%%\begin{figure}[!htbp]

%We can see that the gradient of the graph is 2, which is equal to the common difference, $d$. The

\section{Geometric Sequences}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item Identify and solve problems involving number patterns, including but not limited to
%arithmetic and geometric sequences and series.
%\end{syllabus}

\Definition{Geometric Sequences}{A geometric sequence is a sequence in which every number in the
sequence is equal to the previous number in the sequence, \textbf{multiplied} by a constant number.}

This means that the \textit{ratio} between consecutive numbers in the geometric sequence is a
constant. We will explain what we mean by ratio after looking at the following example.

\subsection{Example - A Flu Epidemic}
\Extension{What is influenza?}{Influenza (commonly called ``the flu'') is caused by the influenza
virus, which infects the respiratory tract (nose, throat, lungs). It can cause mild to severe
illness that most of us get during winter time. The main way that the influenza virus is spread is
from person to person in respiratory droplets of coughs and sneezes. (This is called ``droplet
spread''.) This can happen when droplets from a cough or sneeze of an infected person are propelled
(generally, up to a metre) through the air and deposited on the mouth or nose of people nearby. It
is good practise to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze so as not to infect others around you
when you have the flu.} 

Assume that you have the flu virus, and you forgot to cover your mouth when two friends came to
visit while you were sick in bed. They leave, and the next day they also have the flu. Let's assume
that they in turn spread the virus to two of their friends by the same droplet spread the following
day. Assuming this pattern continues and each sick person infects 2 other friends, we can represent
these events in the following manner:
\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{../ch2sequencesexampleflu.eps}
\caption{Each person infects two more people with the flu virus.}
\label{fig:mp:s:geometricflu}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Again we can tabulate the events and formulate an equation for the general case:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}\hline
\hline \textbf{Day}, $n$ & \textbf{Number of newly-infected people} \\\hline
\hline 1 & $2 \: \: \: = 2$ \\
\hline 2 & $4 \: \: \: = 2 \times 2 = 2 \times 2^1 $ \\
\hline 3 & $8 \: \: \: = 2 \times 4 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 2 \times 2^2$ \\
\hline 4 & $16 \: = 2 \times 8 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 2 \times 2^3$ \\
\hline 5 & $32 \: = 2 \times 16 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 2 \times 2^4$ \\
\hline \vdots & \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \vdots \\
\hline $n$ & $\: \: \quad = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times \ldots \times 2 = 2 \times 2^{n-1}$
\\
\hline\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The above table represents the number of \textbf{newly-infected} people after $n$ days since you
first infected your 2 friends. 

You sneeze and the virus is carried over to 2 people who start the chain ($a_1 = 2$).
The next day, each one then infects 2 of their friends. Now 4 people are newly-infected.
Each of them infects 2 people the third day, and 8 people are infected, and so on.
These events can be written as a geometric sequence:
\begin{eqnarray*}
2; \: 4; \: 8; \: 16; \: 32; \: \ldots
\end{eqnarray*}

Note the common factor (2) between the events. Recall from the linear arithmetic sequence how the
common difference between terms were established. In the geometric sequence we can determine the
\textit{common ratio}, $r$, by

\begin{equation}
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{a_3}{a_2} = r
\end{equation}

Or, more general,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mp:s:geomseq:1}
\frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}} = r
\end{equation}

\Activity{Common Factor of Geometric Sequence}{Determine the common factor for the following
geometric sequences:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{$5, 10, 20, 40, 80, \ldots$}
\item{$\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{8},\ldots$}
\item{$7, 28, 112, 448,\ldots$}
\item{$2, 6, 18, 54,\ldots$}
\item{$-3, 30, -300, 3000,\ldots$}
\end{enumerate}}
% -----------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{General Equation for the $n^{th}$-term of a Geometric Sequence}

From the above example we know $a_1 = 2$ and $r = 2$, and we have seen from the table that the
$n^{th}$-term is given by $a_n = 2 \times 2^{n-1}$. Thus, in general,
\begin{equation}
a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}
\end{equation}
where $a_1$ is the first term and $r$ is called the \textit{common ratio}. 

So, if we want to know how many people are newly-infected after 10 days, we need to work
out $a_{10}$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_n &=& a_1 \cdot r^{n-1} \\
a_{10} &=& 2 \times 2^{10-1} \\
&=& 2 \times 2^9 \\
&=& 2 \times 512 \\
&=& 1024
\end{eqnarray*}

That is, after 10 days, there are 1~024 newly-infected people.

Or, how many days would pass before 16~384 people become newly infected with the flu virus?
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_n &=& a_1 \cdot r^{n-1} \\
16~384 &=& 2 \times 2^{n-1} \\
16~384 \div 2 &=& 2^{n-1} \\
8~192 &=& 2^{n-1} \\
2^{13} &=& 2^{n-1} \\
13 &=& n - 1 \\
n &=& 14
\end{eqnarray*}

That is, 14 days pass before 16~384 people are newly-infected.

\section{Recursive Formulae for Sequences}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item Correctly interpret recursive formulae: (e.g. $T_{n+1}=T_n+T_{n-1}$).
%\end{syllabus}

When discussing arithmetic and quadratic sequences, we noticed that the difference between two
consecutive terms in the sequence could be written in a general way. 

For an arithmetic sequence, where a new term is calculated by taking the previous term and adding a
constant value, $d$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_n = a_{n-1} + d
\end{eqnarray*}
The above equation is an example of a \textit{recursive equation} since we can calculate the
$n^{th}$-term only by considering the previous term in the sequence. Compare this with equation
(\ref{eq:mp:s:arithseq:2}),
\begin{equation}
a_n = a_1 + d \cdot (n - 1)
\end{equation}
where one can directly calculate the $n^{th}$-term of an arithmetic sequence without knowing
previous terms. 

For quadratic sequences, we noticed the difference between consecutive terms is given by
(\ref{eq:mp:s:quadseq:2}):
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_n - a_{n-1} = D \cdot (n-2) + d
\end{eqnarray*}

Therefore, we re-write the equation as
\begin{equation}
a_n = a_{n-1} + D \cdot (n-2) + d
\end{equation}
which is then a recursive equation for a quadratic sequence with common second difference, $D$. 

Using (\ref{eq:mp:s:geomseq:1}), the recursive equation for a geometric sequence is:
\begin{equation}
a_n = r \cdot a_{n-1}
\end{equation}
\\
Recursive equations are extremely powerful: you can work out every term in the series just by
knowing previous terms. As you can see from the examples above, working out $a_n$ using the previous
term $a_{n-1}$ can be a much simpler computation than working out $a_n$ from scratch using a general
formula. This means that using a recursive formula when using a computer to work out a sequence
would mean the computer would finish its calculations significantly quicker.

\Activity{Recursive Formula}{Write the first 5 terms of the following sequences, given their
recursive formulae:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{$a_n=2a_{n-1}+3, a_1=1$}
\item{$a_n=a_{n-1}, a_1=11$}
\item{$a_n=2a^2_{n-1}, a_1=2$}
\end{enumerate}}

\Extension{\textbf{The Fibonacci Sequence}\\
Consider the following sequence:
\begin{eqnarray}
0; \: 1; \: 1; \: 2; \: 3; \: 5; \: 8; \: 13; \: 21; \: 34; \: \ldots
\end{eqnarray}
\\
The above sequence is called the \textit{Fibonacci sequence}. Each new term is calculated by adding the previous two terms. Hence, we can write down the recursive equation:
\begin{eqnarray}
a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}
\end{eqnarray}}

\section{Series}
\label{mp:se}
In this section we simply work on the concept of \textit{adding} up the numbers belonging to arithmetic and geometric sequences. We call the sum of \textit{any} sequence of numbers a \textit{series}.

\subsection{Some Basics}
If we add up the terms of a sequence, we obtain what is called a \textit{series}. If we only sum a finite amount of terms, we get a \textit{finite series}. We use the symbol $S_n$ to mean the sum of the first $n$ terms of a sequence
$\{a_1; \: a_2; \: a_3; \ldots ; a_n \}$:
\begin{eqnarray}
S_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_n
\end{eqnarray}

For example, if we have the following sequence of numbers
\begin{eqnarray*}
1; \: 4; \: 9; \: 25; \: 36; \: 49; \: \ldots
\end{eqnarray*}
and we wish to find the sum of the first 4 terms, then we write
\begin{eqnarray*}
S_4 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 25 = 39
\end{eqnarray*}
The above is an example of a finite series since we are only summing 4 terms.

If we sum infinitely many terms of a sequence, we get an \textit{infinite series}:
\begin{eqnarray}
S_\infty = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Sigma Notation}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item Correctly interpret sigma notation.
%\end{syllabus}

In this section we introduce a notation that will make our lives a little easier.

A sum may be written out using the summation symbol $\sum$\,. This symbol is \textit{sigma}, which is the capital letter ``S'' in the Greek alphabet. It indicates that you must sum the expression to the \textit{right} of it:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mp:se:sigma}
\sum_{i=m}^n a_i = a_m + a_{m+1} + \ldots + a_{n-1}+ a_n
\end{equation}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $i$ is the index of the sum;
\item $m$ is the lower bound (or start index), shown below the summation symbol;
\item $n$ is the upper bound (or end index), shown above the summation symbol;
\item $a_i$ are the terms of a sequence.
\end{itemize}

The index $i$ is increased from $m$ to $n$ in steps of $1$.

If we are summing from $n=1$ (which implies summing from the first term in a sequence), then we can use either $S_n$- or $\sum$-notation since they mean the same thing:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mp:se:Ssigma}
S_n=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n
\end{equation}

For example, in the following sum,
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i=1}^5 i
\end{equation*}
we have to add together all the terms in the sequence $a_i=i$ from $i=1$ up until $i=5$:
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i=1}^5 i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Examples}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{i=1}^6 2^i &=& 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 \\
&=& 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 \\
&=& 126
\end{eqnarray*}
\item
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{i=3}^{10} (3x^i) = 3x^3 + 3x^4 + \ldots + 3x^9 + 3x^{10}
\end{eqnarray*}
for any value $x$.
\end{enumerate}

\item {Given two sequences, $a_i$ and $b_i$,

\end{eqnarray}
}

\item {For any constant $c$ that is not dependent on the index $i$,

%\end{syllabus}

\section{Finite Arithmetic Series}

Remember that an arithmetic sequence is a set of numbers, such that the difference between any term and the previous term is a constant number, $d$, called the \textbf{constant difference}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:mp:series:lin:gen}
a_n = a_1 + d \; (n - 1)
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $n$ is the index of the sequence;
\item $a_n$ is the $n^{th}$-term of the sequence;
\item $a_1$ is the first term;
\item $d$ is the common difference.
\end{itemize}

When we sum a finite number of terms in an arithmetic sequence, we get a \textit{finite arithmetic series}.

The simplest arithmetic sequence is when $a_1=1$ and $d=0$ in the general form \eqref{eq:mp:series:lin:gen}; in other words all the terms in the sequence are 1:
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_i &=& a_1 + d \; (i - 1) \\
&=& 1 + 0 \cdot (i - 1) \\
&=& 1 \\
\{a_i\} &=& \{1; \: 1; \: 1; \: 1; \: 1; \: \ldots \}
\end{eqnarray*}
If we wish to sum this sequence from $i=1$ to any positive integer $n$, we would write
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i=1}^n {a_i} = \sum_{i=1}^n 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + \ldots + 1 \qquad (n\textrm{ times})
\end{equation*}

Since all the terms are equal to 1, it means that if we sum to $n$ we will be adding $n$-number of $1$'s together, which is simply equal to $n$:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\sum_{i=1}^n 1 = n}
\end{equation}

Another simple arithmetic sequence is when $a_1=1$ and $d=1$, which is the sequence of positive integers:
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_i &=& a_1 + d \; (i - 1) \\
&=& 1 + 1 \cdot (i - 1) \\
&=& i \\
\{a_i\} &=& \{1; \: 2; \: 3; \: 4; \: 5; \: \ldots \}
\end{eqnarray*}
If we wish to sum this sequence from $i=1$ to any positive integer $n$, we would write
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mp:se:fa:simple:sum1}
\sum_{i=1}^n i = 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + n
\end{equation}
This is an equation with a very important solution as it gives the answer to the sum of positive integers.

\begin{IFact}{Mathematician, Karl Friedrich Gauss, discovered this proof when he was only 8 years old. His teacher had decided to give his class a problem which would distract them for the entire day by asking them to add all the numbers from 1 to 100. Young Karl realised how to do this almost instantaneously and shocked the teacher with the correct answer, 5050.}
\end{IFact}

We first write $S_n$ as a sum of terms in ascending order:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mp:series:arith:sum_integers1}
S_n = 1 + 2 + \ldots + (n - 1) + n
\end{equation}
\noindent
We then write the same sum but with the terms in descending order:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mp:series:arith:sum_integers2}
S_n = n + (n-1) + \ldots + 2 + 1
\end{equation}
We then add corresponding pairs of terms from equations \eqref{eq:mp:series:arith:sum_integers1} and \eqref{eq:mp:series:arith:sum_integers2}, and we find that the sum for each pair is the same, $(n+1)$:
\begin{equation}
2 \; S_n = (n+1) + (n+1) + \ldots + (n+1) + (n+1)
\end{equation}
We then have $n$-number of $(n+1)$-terms, and by simplifying we arrive at the final result:
\begin{eqnarray*}
2 \; S_n &=& n \; (n + 1) \\
S_n &=& \frac {n}{2} \; (n + 1)
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mp:series:sum_integers}
\boxed{S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac {n}{2} \; (n + 1)}
\end{equation}
Note that this is an example of a quadratic sequence.

\subsection{General Formula for a Finite Arithmetic Series}
If we wish to sum any arithmetic sequence, there is no need to work it out term-for-term. We will now determine the general formula to evaluate a finite arithmetic series. We start with the general formula for an arithmetic sequence and sum it from $i=1$ to any positive integer $n$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{i=1}^n a_i &=& \sum_{i=1}^n \; [a_1 + d \, (i-1)] \\
&=& \sum_{i=1}^n \; (a_1 + di - d) \\
&=& \sum_{i=1}^n \; [(a_1 - d) + di] \\
&=& \sum_{i=1}^n \; (a_1 - d) + \sum_{i=1}^n \; (di) \\
&=& \sum_{i=1}^n \; (a_1 - d) + d \; \sum_{i=1}^n \; i \\
&=& (a_1 - d) \, n + \frac {dn}{2} \; (n + 1) \\
&=& \frac{n}{2} \: (2a_1 - 2d + dn + d) \\
&=& \frac{n}{2} \: (2a_1 + dn - d) \\
&=& \frac{n}{2} \: [\, 2a_1 + d \, (n - 1) \,]
\end{eqnarray*}
So, the general formula for determining an arithmetic series is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mp:se:fa:3}
\boxed {S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n \; [\, a_1 + d \, (i-1) \,] = \frac{n}{2} \: [\, 2a_1 + d \, (n - 1) \,]}
\end{equation}
For example, if we wish to know the series $S_{20}$ for the arithmetic sequence $a_i= 3 + 7 \, (i-1)$, we could either calculate each term individually and sum them:
\begin{eqnarray*}
S_{20} &=& \sum_{i=1}^{20} \; [3 + 7 \, (i-1)] \\
&=& 3 + 10 + 17 + 24 + 31 + 38 + 45 + 52 + \\
&& 59 + 66 + 73 + 80 + 87 + 94 + 101 + \\
&& 108 + 115 + 122 + 129 + 136 \\
&=& 1390
\end{eqnarray*}
or, more sensibly, we could use equation \eqref{eq:mp:se:fa:3} noting that $a_1=3$, $d=7$ and $n=20$ so that
\begin{eqnarray*}
\label{eq:mp:se:fa:ex:smartway}
S_{20} &=& \sum_{i=1}^{20} \; [3 + 7 \, (i-1)] \\
&=& \textstyle \small {\frac{20}{2}} \: [2 \cdot 3 + 7 \, (20 - 1) ] \\
&=& 1390
\end{eqnarray*}
This example demonstrates how useful equation \eqref{eq:mp:se:fa:3} is.

\section{Finite Squared Series}
When we sum a finite number of terms in a quadratic sequence, we get a \textit{finite
quadratic series}. The general form of a quadratic series is quite complicated,
so we will only look at the simple case when $D=2$ and $d=(a_2 - a_1)=3$, where $D$ is the common second difference and $d$ is the finite difference. This is the sequence of squares of the integers:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\label{eq:mp:se:quad:seq}
a_i &=& i^{\,2} \\
\{a_i\} &=& \{1^2; \: 2^2; \: 3^2; \: 4^2; \: 5^2; \: 6^2; \: \ldots \} \\
&=& \{1; \: 4; \: 9; \: 16; \: 25; \: 36; \: \ldots \}
\end{eqnarray*}
If we wish to sum this sequence and create a series, then we write
\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:mp:se:fs:sum}
S_n=\sum_{i=1}^n i^{\,2} = 1 + 4 + 9 + \ldots + n^2
\end{equation*}
which can be written, in general, as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mp:se:fs:2}
\boxed{S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n}{6}(2n + 1)(n + 1)}
\end{equation}
\\
The proof for equation \eqref{eq:mp:se:fs:2} can be found under the Advanced block that follows:
\\
\Extension{Derivation of the Finite Squared Series}{
We will now prove the formula for the finite squared series:
\begin{equation*}
S_n=\sum_{i=1}^n i^{\,2} = 1 + 4 + 9 + \ldots + n^2
\end{equation*}
We start off with the expansion of ${(k + 1)}^3$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
{(k + 1)}^3 &=& k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1 \\
{(k + 1)}^3 - k^3 &=& 3k^2 + 3k + 1
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
k=1 &:& \quad 2^3 - 1^3 = 3(1)^2 + 3(1) + 1 \\
\vspace{6pt} \\
k=2 &:& \quad 3^3 - 2^3 = 3(2)^2 + 3(2) + 1 \\
\vspace{6pt} \\
k=3 &:& \quad 4^3 - 3^3 = 3(3)^2 + 3(3) + 1 \\
&\vdots& \\
k=n &:& \quad {(n + 1)}^3 - n^3 = 3n^2 + 3n + 1
\end{eqnarray*}
If we add all the terms on the right and left, we arrive at
\begin{eqnarray*}
{(n + 1)}^3 - 1 &=& \sum_{i=1}^n \: (3i^2 + 3i + 1) \\
\vspace{12pt} \\
n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1 - 1 &=& 3\,\sum_{i=1}^n \: i^2 + 3\,\sum_{i=1}^n \: i + \sum_{i=1}^n \: 1 \\
\vspace{12pt} \\
n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n &=& 3\,\sum_{i=1}^n \: i^2 + \frac{3n}{2}\,(n + 1) + n \\
\vspace{12pt} \\
\sum_{i=1}^n \: i^2 &=& \frac{1}{3}\,[n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n - \frac{3n}{2}\,(n + 1) - n] \\
\vspace{12pt} \\
&=& \frac{1}{3}\,(n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n - \frac{3}{2}\,n^2 - \frac{3}{2}\,n - n) \\
\vspace{12pt} \\
&=& \frac{1}{3}\,(n^3 + \frac{3}{2}\,n^2 + \frac{1}{2}\,n) \\
\vspace{12pt} \\
&=& \frac{n}{6}\,(2n^2 + 3n + 1)
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore,
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{\sum_{i=1}^n \: i^2 = \frac{n}{6}(2n + 1)(n + 1)}
\end{equation*}}


\section{Finite Geometric Series}
When we sum a known number of terms in a geometric sequence, we get a \textit{finite geometric series}. %We know from \eqref{eq:mp:s:geom:genalt}, that 
We can write out each term of a geometric sequence in the general form:
\begin{equation}
a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $n$ is the index of the sequence;
\item $a_n$ is the $n^{th}$-term of the sequence;
\item $a_1$ is the first term;
\item $r$ is the common ratio (the ratio of any term to the previous term).
\end{itemize}

\vspace{12pt}
By simply adding together the first $n$ terms, we are actually writing out the series
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mp:s:geom:S}
S_n = a_1 + a_1\,r + a_1\,r^2 + \ldots + a_1\,r^{n-2} + a_1\,r^{n-1}
\end{equation}
We may multiply the above equation by $r$ on both sides, giving us
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mp:s:geom:rS}
rS_n = a_1\,r + a_1\,r^2 + a_1\,r^3 + \ldots + a_1\,r^{n-1} + a_1\,r^n
\end{equation}
You may notice that all the terms on the right side of \eqref{eq:mp:s:geom:S} and \eqref{eq:mp:s:geom:rS} are the same, except the first and last terms. If we subtract \eqref{eq:mp:s:geom:S} from \eqref{eq:mp:s:geom:rS}, we are left with just
\begin{eqnarray*}
\label{eq:mp:s:geom:proof}
rS_n - S_n = a_1\,r^n - a_1 \\
S_n(r - 1) = a_1\,(r^n - 1)
\end{eqnarray*}
Dividing by $(r-1)$ on both sides, we arrive at the general form of a geometric series:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mp:se:fg:4}
\boxed{S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n a_1 \cdot r^{i-1} = \frac{a_1 \, (r^n - 1)}{r-1}}
\end{equation}

\section{Infinite Series}
Thus far we have been working only with finite sums, meaning that whenever we determined the sum of a series, we only considered the sum of the first $n$ terms. In this section, we consider what happens when we add infinitely many terms together. You might think that this is a silly question - surely the answer will be $\infty$ when one sums infinitely many numbers, no matter how small they are? The surprising answer is that while in some cases one will reach $\infty$ (like when you try to add all the positive integers together), there are some cases one will get a finite answer. If you don't believe this, try doing the following sum, a geometric series, on your calculator or computer:
$$\tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{4} + \tfrac{1}{8} + \tfrac{1}{16} + \tfrac{1}{32} + \ldots $$
You might think that if you keep adding more and more terms you will eventually get larger and larger numbers, but in fact you won't even get past $1$ - try it and see for yourself!

We denote the sum of an infinite number of terms of a sequence by
\begin{eqnarray*}
S_\infty = \sum^\infty_{i=1} a_i
\end{eqnarray*}

When we sum the terms of a series, and the answer we get after each summation gets closer and closer to some number, we say that the series \textit{converges}. If a series does not converge, then we say that it \textit{diverges}.

\subsection{Infinite Geometric Series}

There is a simple test for knowing instantly which geometric series converges and which diverges. When $r$, the common ratio, is strictly between -1 and 1, i.e. $-1 < r < 1$, the infinite series will converge, otherwise it will diverge. There is also a formula for working out the value to which the series converges.

Let's start off with formula \eqref{eq:mp:se:fg:4} for the finite geometric series:
\begin{equation*}
S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n a_1 \cdot r^{i-1} = \frac{a_1 \, (r^n - 1)}{r-1}
\end{equation*}

Now we will investigate the behaviour of $r^n$ for $-1<r<1$ as n becomes larger.

Take $r=\frac{1}{2}$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
n=1 &:& r^n = r^1 =(\tfrac{1}{2})^1 = \tfrac{1}{2} \\
n=2 &:& r^n = r^2 =(\tfrac{1}{2})^2 = \tfrac{1}{2} \cdot \tfrac{1}{2} = \tfrac{1}{4} < \tfrac{1}{2} \\
n=3 &:& r^n = r^3 =(\tfrac{1}{2})^3 = \tfrac{1}{2} \cdot \tfrac{1}{2} \cdot \tfrac{1}{2} = \tfrac{1}{8} < \tfrac{1}{4}
\end{eqnarray*}

Since $r$ is in the range $-1<r<1$, we see that $r^n$ gets closer to $0$ as n gets larger.

Therefore,
\begin{eqnarray*}
S_n &=& \frac{a_1 \, (r^n - 1)}{r - 1} \\
\vspace{12pt} \\
S_\infty &=& \frac{a_1 \, (0 - 1)}{r - 1} \qquad \mathrm{ for } -1 < r < 1 \\
\vspace{12pt} \\
&=& \frac {-a_1}{r - 1} \\
\vspace{12pt} \\
&=& \frac {a_1}{1 - r}
\end{eqnarray*}

The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:mp:se:ig:4}
\boxed{S_\infty = \sum_{i=1}^\infty a_1r^{i-1} = \frac {a_1}{1-r} \qquad \mathrm{ for } \qquad -1<r<1 }
\end{eqnarray}
where $a_1$ is the first term of the series and $r$ is the common ratio.
