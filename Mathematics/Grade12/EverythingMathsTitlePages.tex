{ \Large
Mathematics is commonly thought of as being about numbers but mathematics is actually a language! Mathematics is the language that nature speaks to us in. As we learn to understand and speak this language, we can discover many of nature’s secrets. Just as understanding someone’s language is necessary to learn more about them, mathematics is required to learn about all aspects of the world -- whether it is physical sciences, life sciences or even finance and economics.\par


The great writers and poets of the world have the ability to draw on words and put them together in
ways that can tell beautiful or inspiring stories. In a similar way, one can draw on mathematics to
explain and create new things. Many of the modern technologies that have enriched our lives are
greatly dependent on mathematics. DVDs, Google searches, bank cards with PIN numbers are just
some examples. And just as words were not created specifically to tell a story but their existence enabled
stories to be told, so the mathematics used to create these technologies was not developed for its own sake,
but was available to be drawn on when the time for its application was right.\par


There is in fact not an area of life that is not affected by mathematics. Many of the most sought after
careers depend on the use of mathematics. Civil engineers use mathematics to determine how to best
design new structures; economists use mathematics to describe and predict how the economy will react
to certain changes; investors use mathematics to price certain types of shares or calculate how risky
particular investments are; software developers use mathematics for many of the algorithms (such as
Google searches and data security) that make programmes useful.\par



But, even in our daily lives mathematics is everywhere – in our use of distance, time and money.
Mathematics is even present in art, design and music as it informs proportions and musical tones. The
greater our ability to understand mathematics, the greater our ability to appreciate beauty and
everything in nature. Far from being just a cold and abstract discipline, mathematics
embodies logic, symmetry, harmony and technological progress. More than any other language,
mathematics is everywhere and universal in its application.\par

{\Large
\textbf{\textit{Everything Maths}} is not just a Mathematics textbook. It has everything you expect from
your regular printed school textbook, but comes with a whole lot more. For a start, you can download or read it
on-line on your mobile phone, computer or iPad, which means you have the convenience of accessing
it wherever you are.\par


We know that some things are hard to explain in words. That is why every chapter comes with video
lessons and explanations which help bring the ideas and concepts to life. Summary presentations at
the end of every chapter offer an overview of the content covered, with key points highlighted for easy
revision.\par


All the exercises inside the book link to a service where you can get more practice, see the full solution
or test your skills level on mobile and PC.\par


We are interested in what you think, wonder about or struggle with as you read through the book and
attempt the exercises. That is why we made it possible for you to use your mobile phone or computer to
digitally pin your question to a page and see what questions and answers other readers pinned up.\par


This book is the same one used by Mindset Learn in their new television broadcast, where experienced educators work through it, explain the concepts and work out exercises from the book.

Have you ever had a question about a specific fact, formula or exercise in your textbook and wished you could just ask someone? Surely someone else in the country must have had the same question at the same place in the textbook.\par 

We invite you to open the textbook on your mobile phone or computer and pin your question at that  exact spot in the textbook using the shortcode. You will be able to see whether it has been asked before and what the given answer to that question is. \par

The short codes at section headings helps you navigate to sections in the book to ask and view questions for that section. The short codes for the exercises lets you look at questions and answers relating to those specific exercises.\par
