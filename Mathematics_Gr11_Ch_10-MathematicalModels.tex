\chapter{Mathematical Models - Grade 11}
\label{m:se:m11}

Up until now, you have only learnt how to solve equations and inequalities, but there has not been much application of what you have learnt. This chapter builds on this knowledge and introduces you to the idea of a \textit{mathematical model} which uses mathematical concepts to solve real-world problems.

%\begin{syllabus}
%\item Use mathematical models to investigate problems that arise in real-life contexts:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item making conjectures, demonstrating and explaining their validity;
%\item expressing and justifying mathematical generalisations of situations;
%\item using various representations to interpolate and extrapolate;
%\item describing a situation by interpreting graphs, or drawing graphs from a description of a situation, with special focus on trends and pertinent features. (Examples should include issues related to health, social, economic, cultural, political and environmental matters.)
%\end{itemize}
%\end{syllabus}

\Definition{Mathematical Model}{A mathematical model is a method of using the mathematical language to describe the behaviour of a physical system. Mathematical models are used particularly in the natural sciences and engineering disciplines (such as physics, biology, and electrical engineering) but also in the social sciences (such as economics, sociology and political science); physicists, engineers, computer scientists, and economists use mathematical models most extensively.}

A mathematical model is an equation (or a set of equations for the more difficult problems) that describes a particular situation.
For example, if Anna receives R$3$ for each time she helps her mother wash the dishes and R$5$ for each time she helps her father cut the grass, how much money will Anna earn if she helps her mother to wash the dishes five times and helps her father to wash the car twice?
The first step to modelling is to write the equation, that describes the situation. To calculate how much Anna will earn we see that she will earn :

\begin{eqnarray*}
&5 &\times \mbox{ R}3 \quad \mbox{for washing the dishes}\\
+&2 &\times \mbox{ R}5 \quad \mbox{for cutting the grass}\\
=& \mbox{R}15&+\mbox{ R}10\\
=& \mbox{ R}25
\end{eqnarray*}
If however, we ask: "What is the equation if Anna helps her mother $x$ times and her father $y$ times?", then we have:

\nequ{\mbox{Total earned}=(x\times \mbox{R}3) + (y\times \mbox{R}5)}

\section{Real-World Applications: Mathematical Models}
Some examples of where mathematical models are used in the real-world are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{To model population growth}
\item{To model effects of air pollution}
\item{To model effects of global warming}
\item{In computer games}
\item{In the sciences (e.g. physics, chemistry, biology) to understand how the natural world works}
\item{In simulators that are used to train people in certain jobs, like pilots, doctors and soldiers}
\item{In medicine to track the progress of a disease}
\end{enumerate}

\Activity{Investigation}{Simple Models}{In order to get used to the idea of
mathematical models, try the following simple models. Write an equation that
describes the following real-world situations, mathematically:
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Jack and Jill both have colds. Jack sneezes twice for each sneeze of Jill's. If Jill sneezes $x$ times, write an equation describing how many times they both sneezed?}
\item{It rains half as much in July as it does in December. If it rains $y$~mm in July, write an expression relating the rainfall in July and December.}
\item{Zane can paint a room in $4$ hours. Billy can paint a room in $2$ hours. How long will it take both of them to paint a room together?}
\item{25 years ago, Arthur was $5$ more than $\frac{1}{3}$ as old as Lee was. Today, Lee is $26$ less than twice Arthur's age. How old is Lee?}
\item{Kevin has played a few games of ten-pin bowling. In the third game, Kevin scored $80$ more than in the second game. In the first game Kevin scored $110$ less than the third game. His total score for the first two games was $208$. If he wants an average score of $146$, what must he score on the fourth game?}
\item{Erica has decided to treat her friends to coffee at the Corner Coffee House. Erica paid R$54,00$ for four cups of cappuccino and three cups of filter coffee. If a cup of cappuccino costs R$3,00$ more than a cup of filter coffee, calculate how much each type of coffee costs?}

\begin{wex}{More Mathematical Modelling}
{A researcher is investigating the number of trees in a forest over a period of $n$ years. After investigating numerous data, the following data model emerged:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline
Year& Number of trees (in hundreds)\\\hline
$1$ & $1$\\\hline
$2$ & $3$ \\\hline
$3$ & $9$ \\\hline
$4$ & $27$ \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{How many trees, in hundreds, are there in the sixth year if this pattern is
continued?}
\item{Determine an algebraic expression that describes the number of trees in the $n^{th}$ year in the forest.}
\item{Do you think this model, which determines the number of trees in the forest, will continue indefinitely? Give a reason for your answer.}
\end{enumerate}
}{
\westep{Find the pattern}
The pattern is $3^0; 3^1; 3^2; 3^3;\ldots$\\
Therefore, three to the power one less than the year.\\
\westep{Trees in year 6}
\nequ{\mbox{Year 6 : }3^5 \mbox{ hundred }= 243 \mbox{ hundred }= 24 300}
\westep{Algebraic expression for year $n$}
\nequ{\mbox{Number of trees }= 3^{n-1}\mbox{ hundred}}
\westep{Conclusion}
No, the number of trees will not increase indefinitely. The number of trees will increase for some time. Yet, eventually the number of trees will not increase any more. It will be limited by factors such as the limited amount of water and nutrients available in the ecosystem.

\Extension{Simulations}{A simulation is an attempt to model a real-life
situation on a computer so that it can be studied to see how the system works.
By changing variables, predictions may be made about the behaviour of the
system.
Simulation is used in many contexts, including the modeling of natural systems or human systems in order to gain insight into their functioning. Other contexts include simulation of technology for performance optimization, safety engineering, testing, training and education. Simulation can be used to show the eventual real effects of alternative conditions and courses of action.

\textbf{Simulation in education}
Simulations in education are somewhat like training simulations. They focus on specific tasks. In the past, video has been used for teachers and education students to observe, problem solve and role play; however, a more recent use of simulations in education is that of animated narrative vignettes (ANV). ANVs are cartoon-like video narratives of hypothetical and reality-based stories involving classroom teaching and learning. ANVs have been used to assess knowledge, problem solving skills and dispositions of children and pre-service and in-service teachers.}
