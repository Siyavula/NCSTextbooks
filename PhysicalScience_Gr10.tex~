\chapter{Units}
\label{pd}

\section{Introduction}
Imagine you had to make curtains and needed to buy fabric. The
shop assistant would need to know how much fabric you needed.
Telling her you need fabric 2 wide and 6 long would be
insufficient --- you have to specify the {\bf unit} (i.e. 2 {\it
metres} wide and 6 {\it metres} long). Without the unit the
information is incomplete and the shop assistant would have to
guess. If you were making curtains for a doll's house the
dimensions might be 2 centimetres wide and 6 centimetres long!

It is not just lengths that have units, all physical quantities
have units (e.g. time, temperature, distance, etc.).

\Definition{Physical Quantity}{A physical quantity is anything
that you can measure. For example, length, temperature, distance
and time are physical quantities.}

\section{Unit Systems}
\subsection{SI Units}
We will be using the SI units in this course. SI units are the
internationally agreed upon units. Historically these units are
based on the metric system which was developed in France at the
time of the French Revolution.

\Definition{SI Units}{The name \textit{SI units} comes from the
French \emph{Syst\`{e}me International d'Unit\'{e}s}, which means
\textit{international system of units}.}

There are seven base SI units. These are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:units:SIunits}. All physical quantities have units
which can be built from these seven base units. These seven units
were defined to be the base units. So, it is possible to create a
different set of units by defining a different set of base units.

These seven units are called base units because none of them can
be expressed as combinations of the other six. This is identical
to bricks and concrete being the base units of a building. You can
build different things using different combinations of bricks and
concrete. The 26 letters of the alphabet are the base units for a
language like English. Many different words can be formed by using
these letters.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
\textbf{Base quantity} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Symbol} \\
\hline length & metre & m\\ \hline mass & kilogram & kg\\
\hline time & second & s\\ \hline electric current & ampere& A\\
\hline temperature & kelvin & K\\ \hline amount of substance &
mole & mol\\ \hline luminous intensity & candela & cd\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{SI Base Units}\label{tab:units:SIunits}
\end{table}

\pagebreak[4]
\subsection{The Other Systems of Units}
The SI Units are not the only units available, but they are most
widely used. In Science there are three other sets of units that
can also be used. These are mentioned here for interest only.

\subsubsection{c.g.s Units}
In the c.g.s. system, the metre is replaced by the centimetre and
the kilogram is replaced by the gram. This is a simple change but
it means that all units derived from these two are changed. For
example, the units of force and work are different. These units
are used most often in astrophysics and atomic physics.

\subsubsection{Imperial Units}
Imperial units arose when kings and queens decided the measures
that were to be used in the land. All the imperial base units,
except for the measure of time, are different to those of SI
units. This is the unit system you are most likely to encounter if
SI units are not used. Examples of imperial units are pounds,
miles, gallons and yards. These units are used by the Americans and
British. As you can imagine, having different units in use from
place to place makes scientific communication very difficult. This
was the motivation for adopting a set of internationally agreed
upon units.

\subsubsection{Natural Units}
This is the most sophisticated choice of units. Here the most
fundamental discovered quantities (such as the speed of light) are
set equal to 1. The argument for this choice is that all other
quantities should be built from these fundamental units. This
system of units is used in high energy physics and quantum
mechanics.

\section{Writing Units as Words or Symbols}
Unit names are always written with a lowercase first letter, for
example, we write metre and litre. The symbols or
abbreviations of units are also written with lowercase initials,
for example $m$ for metre and $\ell$ for litre. The exception to
this rule is if the unit is named after a person, then the
symbol is a capital letter. For example, the kelvin was named
after Lord Kelvin and its symbol is K. If the abbreviation of the unit that is named after a person has two letters, the second letter is lowercase, for example Hz for hertz.

\Exercise{Naming of Units}{
For the following symbols of units that you will come across later
in this book, write whether you think the unit is named after a
person or not.
\begin{enumerate}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\item{J (joule)}
\item{$\ell$ (litre)}
\item{N (newton)}
\item{mol (mole)}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\item{C (coulomb)}
\item{lm (lumen)}
\item{m (metre)}
\item{bar (bar)}
\end{minipage}
\end{enumerate}
}

\pagebreak[4]
\section{Combinations of SI Base Units}
To make working with units easier, some combinations of the base
units are given special names, but it is always correct to reduce
everything to the base units. Table~\ref{tab:dim:combos} lists
some examples of combinations of SI base units that are assigned
special names. Do not be concerned if the formulae look unfamiliar
at this stage - we will deal with each in detail in the chapters
ahead (as well as many others)!

It is very important that you are able to recognise the units
correctly. For instance, the {\bf newton} (N) is another name for force, which is defined as {\bf kilogram metre per second squared} 
(kg$\cdot$m$\cdot$s$^{-2}$), while work is measured in {\bf kilogram metre squared per second squared} (kg$\cdot$m$^2$ $\cdot$s$^{-2}$) and is called the
{\bf joule} (J).

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline
\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Quantity}}& \multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Formula}}&\textbf{Unit Expressed in}&\textbf{Name of}\\
& &\textbf{Base Units}&\textbf{Combination} \\\hline
Force & $ma$ & kg$\cdot$m$\cdot$s$^{-2}$ & N (newton) \\
Frequency & $\frac{1}{T}$ & s$^{-1}$ & Hz (hertz)\\
Work & $F.s$ & kg$\cdot$m$^2$ $\cdot$s$^{-2}$ & J (joule) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Some examples of combinations of SI base units assigned
special names}\label{tab:dim:combos}
\end{table}

\Tip{When writing combinations of base SI units, place a dot
($\cdot$) between the units to indicate that different base units
are used. For example, the symbol for metres per second is
correctly written as \ms, and not as ms$^{-1}$ or m/s.}

\section{Rounding, Scientific Notation and Significant Figures}
\subsection{Rounding Off}
Certain numbers may take an infinite amount of paper and ink to write out. Not only is that impossible, but writing numbers out to a high accuracy (many decimal places) is very inconvenient and rarely gives better answers. For this reason we often estimate the number to a certain number of decimal places.
Rounding off or approximating a decimal number to a given number of decimal places is the quickest way to approximate a number. For example, if you wanted to round-off $2,6525272$ to three decimal places then you would first count three places after the decimal.
\nequ{2,652|5272}
All numbers to the right of $|$ are ignored after you determine whether the number in the third decimal place must be rounded up or rounded down. You \textit{round up} the final digit (make the digit one more) if the first digit after the $|$ was greater or equal to 5 and \textit{round down} (leave the digit alone) otherwise.
So, since the first digit after the $|$ is a 5, we must round up the digit in the third decimal place to a 3 and the final answer of $2,6525272$ rounded to three decimal places is 2,653.

\begin{wex}{Rounding-off}{Round-off $\pi=3,141592654\ldots$ to 4 decimal places.}
{\westep{Determine the last digit that is kept and mark the cut-off with $|$.}
$\pi=3,1415|92654\ldots$
\westep{Determine whether the last digit is rounded up or down.}
The last digit of $\pi=3,1415|92654\ldots$ must be rounded up because there is a 9 after the $|$.
\westep{Write the final answer.}
$\pi=3,1416$ rounded to 4 decimal places.}
\end{wex}

\pagebreak[4]
\begin{wex}{Rounding-off}{Round-off $9,191919\ldots$ to 2 decimal places}
{\westep{Determine the last digit that is kept and mark the cut-off with $|$.}
$9,19|1919\ldots$
\westep{Determine whether the last digit is rounded up or down.}
The last digit of $9,19|1919\dots$ must be rounded down because there is a 1 after the~$|$.
\westep{Write the final answer.}
Answer = 9,19 rounded to 2 decimal places.}
\end{wex}

\subsection{Error Margins}
In a calculation that has many steps, it is best to leave the rounding off right until the end.
For example, Jack and Jill walk to school. They walk 0,9 kilometers to get to school and it takes them 17 minutes. We can calculate their speed in the following two ways. 

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}\hline
\textbf{Method 1}& \textbf{Method 2} \\\hline
Change 17 minutes to hours: & Change 17 minutes to hours:\\
time =$ \frac{17}{60} $ & time =$ \frac{17}{60} $\\
= 0,283333333~km & = 0,28~km\\\hline
Speed =$\frac{Distance}{Time}$ & Speed =$\frac{Distance}{Time}$\\
= $\frac{0,9}{0,28333333}$ & =$ \frac{0,9}{0,28}$\\
= 3,176470588 & = 3,214285714\\\hline
3,18~\kph & 3,21~\kph\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Rounding numbers}
\label{tab:dim:rounding}
\end{table}

You will see that we get two different answers. In Method 1 no rounding was done, but in Method 2, the time was rounded to 2 decimal places. This made a big difference to the answer. The answer in Method 1 is more accurate because rounded numbers were not used in the calculation. Always round off only your final answer.

\subsection{Scientific Notation}
In Science one often needs to work with very large or very small numbers. These can be written more easily in scientific notation, in the general form
\begin{equation*}
\label{mn:a:sci}
d \times 10^e
\end{equation*}
where $d$ is a decimal number between 0 and 10 that is rounded off to a few decimal places. $e$~is known as the \textit{exponent} and is an integer.
If $e>0$ it represents how many times the decimal place in $d$ should be moved to the right. If $e<0$, then it represents how many times the decimal place in $d$ should be moved to the left. For example $3,24\times 10^3$ represents $3240$ (the decimal moved three places to the right) and $3,24\times 10^{-3}$ represents $0,00324$ (the decimal moved three places to the left).

If a number must be converted into scientific notation, we need to work out how many times the number must be multiplied or divided by 10 to make it into a number between 1 and 10 (i.e. the value of $e$) and what this number between 1 and 10 is (the value of $d$). We do this by counting the number of decimal places the decimal comma must move.

For example, write the speed of light in scientific notation, to two decimal places. The speed of light is 299 792 458 m$\cdot$s$^{-1}$. First, find where the decimal comma must go for two decimal places (to find $d$) and then count how many places there are after the decimal comma to determine $e$.

In this example, the decimal comma must go after the first 2, but since the number after the second 9 is 7, $d=3,00$. $e=8$ because there are 8 digits left after the decimal comma. So the speed of light in scientific notation, to two decimal places is 3,00 $\times$ 10$^{8}$ \ms.

\pagebreak[4]
\subsection{Significant Figures}
In a number, each non-zero digit is a significant figure. Zeroes are only counted if they are between two non-zero digits or are at the end of the decimal part. For example, the number 2000 has 1 significant figure (the 2), but 2000,0 has 5 significant figures. You estimate a number like this by removing significant figures from the number (starting from the right) until you have the desired number of significant figures, rounding as you go. For example 6,827 has 4 significant figures, but if you wish to write it to 3 significant figures it would mean removing the 7 and rounding up, so it would be 6,83. 

\Exercise{Using Significant Figures}{
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Round the following numbers:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{123,517 $\ell$ to 2 decimal places}
\item{14,328 km$\cdot$h$^{-1}$ to one decimal place}
\item{0,00954 m to 3 decimal places}
\end{enumerate}}
\item{Write the following quantities in scientific notation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{10130 Pa to 2 decimal places}
\item{978,15 m$\cdot$s$^{-2}$ to one decimal place}
\item{0,000001256 A to 3 decimal places}
\end{enumerate}}
\item{Count how many significant figures each of the quantities below has:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{2,590 km}
\item{12,305 m$\ell$}
\item{7800 kg}
\end{enumerate}}
\end{enumerate}
}
%\pagebreak[4]
\section{Prefixes of Base Units}
Now that you know how to write numbers in scientific notation, another important aspect of units is the prefixes that are used with the units. 

\Definition{Prefix}{A prefix is a group of letters that are placed in front of a word. The effect of the prefix is to change meaning of the word. For example, the prefix \textit{un} is often added to a word to mean \textit{not}, as in \textit{un}necessary which means \textit{not necessary}.}

In the case of units, the prefixes have a special use. The kilogram (kg) is a simple example.\\ 1 kg is equal to 1 000 g or $1\times 10^3$ g. Grouping the $10^3$ and the g together we can replace the $10^3$ with the prefix k (kilo). Therefore the k takes the place of the $10^3$. \\
The kilogram is unique in that it is the only SI base unit containing a prefix.\\
\\
In Science, all the prefixes used with units are some power of 10. Table~\ref{tab:dim:prefixes} lists some of these prefixes. You will not use most of these prefixes, but those prefixes listed in \textbf{bold} should be learnt. The case of the prefix symbol is very important. Where a letter features twice in the table, it is written in uppercase for exponents bigger than one and in lowercase for exponents less than one. For example M means mega (10$^6$) and m means milli (10$^{-3}$).

\pagebreak[4]
\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|c|c|}\hline
\textbf{Prefix}& \textbf{Symbol}& \textbf{Exponent}& \textbf{Prefix}& \textbf{Symbol}& \textbf{Exponent} \\\hline
yotta & Y& $10^{24}$ & yocto& y & $10^{- 24}$ \\\hline
zetta & Z & $10^{21}$ & zepto & z & $10^{- 21}$ \\\hline
exa & E & $10^{18}$ & atto & a & $10^{- 18}$ \\\hline
peta & P & $10^{15}$ & femto & f & $10^{- 15}$ \\\hline
tera & T & $10^{12}$ & pico & p & $10^{- 12}$ \\ \hline

{\bf mega} & M & $10^6$ & {\bf micro} & $\mu$ & $10^{- 6}$ \\\hline
{\bf kilo} & k & $10^3$ & {\bf milli} & m & $10^{- 3}$ \\\hline
{\bf hecto} & h& $10^2$ & {\bf centi} & c & $10^{- 2}$ \\\hline
{\bf deca} & da & $10^1$ & {\bf deci} & d & $10^{- 1}$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Unit Prefixes}\label{tab:dim:prefixes}
\end{table}

\Tip{There is no space and no dot between the prefix and the symbol for the unit.}

Here are some examples of the use of prefixes:
\begin{itemize}
\item {40000 m can be written as 40 km (kilometre)}
\item {0,001 g is the same as $1\times10^{-3}$ g and can be written as 1 mg (milligram)}
\item {$2,5\times10^{6}$ N can be written as 2,5 MN (meganewton)}
\item {250000 A can be written as 250 kA (kiloampere) or 0,250 MA (megaampere)}
\item {0,000000075 s can be written as 75 ns (nanoseconds)}
\item {$3\times10^{-7}$ mol can be rewritten as $0,3\times10^{-6}$ mol, which is the same as 0,3 $\mu$mol (micromol)}
\end{itemize}

\Exercise{Using Scientific Notation}{
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Write the following in scientific notation using Table~\ref{tab:dim:prefixes} as a reference.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{0,511 MV}
\item{10 c$\ell$}
\item{0,5 $\mu$m}

\item{0,0075 $\times 10^{6}$ m}
\end{enumerate}
}
\end{enumerate}
}

\section{The Importance of Units}
Without units much of our work as scientists would be meaningless. We need to express our thoughts clearly and units give meaning to the numbers we measure and calculate. Depending on which units we use, the numbers are different. For example if you have 12 water, it means nothing. You could have 12 ml of water, 12 litres of water, or even 12 bottles of water. Units are an essential part of the language we use. Units must be specified when expressing physical quantities. Imagine that you are baking a cake, but the units, like grams and millilitres, for the flour, milk, sugar and baking powder are not specified!

\Activity{Investigation}{Importance of Units}{Work in groups of 5 to discuss other possible situations where using the incorrect set of units can be to your disadvantage or even dangerous. Look for examples at home, at school, at a hospital, when travelling and in a shop.}

\Activity{Case Study}{The importance of units}
{Read the following extract from CNN News 30 September 1999 and answer the questions below.\\

{\bf NASA: Human error caused loss of Mars orbiter November 10, 1999}\\

Failure to convert English measures to metric values caused the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter, a spacecraft that smashed into the planet instead of reaching a safe orbit, a NASA investigation concluded Wednesday.\\
The Mars Climate Orbiter, a key craft in the space agency's exploration of the red planet, vanished on 23 September after a 10 month journey. It is believed that the craft came dangerously close to the atmosphere of Mars, where it presumably burned and broke into pieces.\\
An investigation board concluded that NASA engineers failed to convert English measures of rocket thrusts to newton, a metric system measuring rocket force. One English pound of force equals 4,45 newtons. A small difference between the two values caused the spacecraft to approach Mars at too low an altitude and the craft is thought to have smashed into the planet's atmosphere and was destroyed.\\
The spacecraft was to be a key part of the exploration of the planet. From its station about the red planet, the Mars Climate Orbiter was to relay signals from the Mars Polar Lander, which is scheduled to touch down on Mars next month.\\
``The root cause of the loss of the spacecraft was a failed translation of English units into metric units and a segment of ground-based, navigation-related mission software,'' said Arthus Stephenson, chairman of the investigation board.\\
{\bf Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Why did the Mars Climate Orbiter crash? Answer in your own words.}
\item{How could this have been avoided?}
\item{Why was the Mars Orbiter sent to Mars?}
\item{Do you think space exploration is important? Explain your answer.}
\end{enumerate}
}

\section{How to Change Units}
It is very important that you are aware that different systems of units exist. Furthermore, you must be able to convert between units. Being able to change between units (for example, converting from millimetres to metres) is a useful skill in Science.

\pagebreak[4]
The following conversion diagrams will help you change from one unit to another.

If you want to change millimetre to metre, you divide by 1000 (follow the arrow from mm to m); or if you want to change kilometre to millimetre, you multiply by 1000$\times$1000.\\
\\
The same method can be used to change millilitre to litre or kilolitre. Use figure \ref{ch2:conversion2} to change volumes:

\subsection{Two other useful conversions}
Very often in Science you need to convert speed and temperature. The following two rules will help you do this:\\
\\
{\bf{Converting speed}}\\
When converting km$\cdot$h$^{-1}$ to \ms you divide by 3,6. For example 72 km$\cdot$h$^{-1}$ $\div$~3,6 = 20 \ms.

When converting \ms to km$\cdot$h$^{-1}$, you multiply by 3,6. For example 30 \ms $\times$3,6~=~108~km$\cdot$h$^{-1}$.\\

{\bf{Converting temperature}}\\
Converting between the kelvin and celsius temperature scales is easy. To convert from celsius to kelvin add 273. To convert from kelvin to celsius subtract 273. Representing the kelvin temperature by $T_{K}$ and the celsius temperature by $T_{^oC}$,
\begin{equation*}
T_K = T_{^oC} + 273
\end{equation*}

%\pagebreak[4]
\section{A sanity test}
A sanity test is a method of checking whether an answer makes sense. All we have to do is to take a careful look at our answer and ask the question \textit{Does the answer make sense?}

Imagine you were calculating the number of people in a classroom. If the answer you got was 1~000~000 people you would know it was wrong --- it is not possible to have that many people in a classroom. That is all a sanity test is --- is your answer insane or not? 

It is useful to have an idea of some numbers before we start. For example, let us consider masses. An average person has a mass around 70 kg, while the heaviest person in medical history had a mass of 635 kg. If you ever have to calculate a person's mass and you get 7 000 kg, this should fail your sanity check --- your answer is insane and you must have made a mistake somewhere. In the same way an answer of 0.01 kg should fail your sanity test.

The only problem with a sanity check is that you must know what typical values for things are. For example, finding the number of learners in a classroom you need to know that there are usually 20--50 people in a classroom. If you get and answer of 2500, you should realise that it is wrong. 

\Activity{The scale of the matter...}{Try to get an idea of the typical values for the following physical quantities and write your answers into the table:\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|c|c|} \hline
\bf Category & \bf Quantity & \bf Minimum & \bf Maximum \\ \hline
\multirow{2}{*}{People} & mass & & \\\cline{2-4}

\section{Summary}
\begin{enumerate}
\item You need to know the seven base SI Units as listed in table~\ref{tab:units:SIunits}. Combinations of SI Units can have different names.
\item Unit names and abbreviations are written with lowercase letter unless it is named after a person.
\item Rounding numbers and using scientific notation is important.
\item Table \ref{tab:dim:prefixes} summarises the prefixes used in Science.
\item Use figures \ref{ch2:conversion1} and \ref{ch2:conversion2} to convert between units.
\end{enumerate}
%In this chapter we have discussed the importance of units. We have discovered that there are many different units to describe the same thing, although you should stick to SI units in your calculations. We have also discussed how to convert between different units. This is a skill you must acquire.

Version 1.2, November 2002 \\
Copyright \copyright\ 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.\\
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

\section*{PREAMBLE}

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document ``free'' in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or non-commercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of ``copyleft'', which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


\section*{APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS}
\label{applicability}

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The ``Document'', below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as ``you''.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A ``Modified Version'' of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A ``Secondary Section'' is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The ``Invariant Sections'' are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The ``Cover Texts'' are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A ``Transparent'' copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not ``Transparent'' is called ``Opaque''.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, \LaTeX\ input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The ``Title Page'' means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page'' means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section ``Entitled XYZ'' means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as ``Acknowledgements'',
``Dedications'', ``Endorsements'', or ``History''.)  To ``Preserve the Title''
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section ``Entitled XYZ'' according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.


\section*{VERBATIM COPYING}
\label{verbatim}

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or non-commercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in
section~\ref{copying}.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


\section*{COPYING IN QUANTITY}
\label{copying}

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


\section*{MODIFICATIONS}
\label{modifications}

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections~\ref{verbatim} and \ref{copying} above,
provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
\item List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
\item State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
\item Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
\item Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
\item Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
\item Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
\item Include an unaltered copy of this License.
\item Preserve the section Entitled ``History'', Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled ``History'' in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
\item Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the ``History'' section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
\item For any section Entitled ``Acknowledgements'' or ``Dedications'',
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
\item Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
\item Delete any section Entitled ``Endorsements''.  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
\item Do not re-title any existing section to be Entitled ``Endorsements''
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
\item Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
\end{enumerate}

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organisation as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


\section*{COMBINING DOCUMENTS}
\label{combining}

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section~\ref{modifications}
above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ``History''
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
``History''; likewise combine any sections Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
and any sections Entitled ``Dedications''.  You must delete all sections
Entitled ``Endorsements''.


\section*{COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS}
\label{collections}

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


\section*{AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS}
\label{aggregation}

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an ``aggregate'' if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section~\ref{copying} is applicable to
these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


\section*{TRANSLATION}
\label{translation}

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of
section~\ref{modifications}.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
``Dedications'', or ``History'', the requirement
(section~\ref{modifications}) to Preserve
its Title (section~\ref{applicability}) will typically require
changing the actual title.


\section*{TERMINATION}
\label{termination}

You may not copy, modify, sub-license, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sub-license or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


\section*{FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE}
\label{future}

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License ``or any later version'' applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


\section*{ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents}

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

\begin{quote}
    Copyright \copyright\ YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
    Free Documentation License''.
\end{quote}

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the ``with...Texts.'' line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
