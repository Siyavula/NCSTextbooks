\section{Introduction}
In Grade 10 we studied exponential numbers and learnt that there were six laws that made working with exponential numbers easier. There is one law that we did not study in Grade 10. This will be described here.

\section{Laws of Exponents}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item Simplify expressions using the laws of exponents for rational exponents.
%\item Understand that not all numbers are real. (This requires the recognition but not the study of non-real numbers.)
%\end{syllabus}

In Grade 10, we worked only with indices that were integers. What happens when the index is not an integer, but is a rational number? This leads us to the final law of exponents,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mn:e:law7}
a^{\frac{m}{n}}= \sqrt[n]{a^m}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Exponential Law 7: $a^{\frac mn}=\sqrt[n]{a^m}$}
We say that $x$ is an $n$th root of $b$ if $x^n=b$ and we write $x=\sqrt[n]{b}$. $n^{\rm th}$ roots written with the radical symbol, $\sqrt{~}$, are referred to as surds. For example, $(-1)^4=1$, so $-1$ is a $4^{th}$ root of 1. Using Law 6 from Grade 10, we notice that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mn:e:law7:col} 
(a^{\frac mn})^n=a^{\frac mn\times{n}}=a^m
\end{equation}
therefore $a^{\frac mn}$ must be an $n$th root of $a^m$. We can therefore say
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mn:e:law7:proof}
a^{\frac mn}=\sqrt[n]{a^m}
\end{equation}

For example,
\nequ{2^{\frac{2}{3}} =\sqrt[3]{2^2}}

A number may not always have a real $n$th root. For example, if $n=2$ and
$a=-1$, then there is no real number such that $x^2=-1$ because $x^2 \geq 0 $ for all real numbers $x$.

\Extension{Complex Numbers}{There are numbers which can solve problems like
$x^2=-1$, but they are beyond the scope of this book. They are called
\textit{complex numbers}.}

It is also possible for more than one $n$th root of a number to exist. For example, $(-2)^2=4$ and $2^2=4$, so both $-2$ and $2$ are $2^{nd}$ (square) roots of $4$. Usually, if there is more than one root, we choose the positive real solution and move on.

\section{Exponentials in the Real World}
In Grade 10 Finance, you used exponentials to calculate different types of interest, for example on a savings account or on a loan and compound growth. 

\begin{wex}{Exponentials in the Real world}
{A type of bacteria has a very high exponential growth rate at 80\% every hour. If there are 10 bacteria, determine how many there will be in 5 hours, in 1 day and in 1 week?}{ 
\westep{$Population = Initial~population\times (1+ growth~percentage)^{time~period~ in~hours}$}
Therefore, in this case:\\
$Population = 10(1,8)^n$,   where $n$ = number of hours
\westep{In 5 hours}
$Population =10(1,8)^5 = 189$
\westep{In 1 day = 24 hours}
$Population = 10(1,8)^{24} = 13~382~588$
\westep{in 1 week = 168 hours}
$Population = 10(1,8)^{168} = 7,687 \times 10^{43}$\\
Note this answer is given in scientific notation as it is a very big number.}
\end{wex}

\begin{wex}{More Exponentials in the Real world} 
{A species of extremely rare, deep water fish has an extremely long lifespan and rarely have children. If there are a total 821 of this type of fish and their growth rate is 2\% each month, how many will there be in half of a year? What will the population be in 10 years and in 100 years?}{
\westep{$Population = Initial~population\times (1+ growth~percentage)^{time~period~ in~months}$}
Therefore, in this case:\\
$Population = 821(1,02)^n$,   where $n$ = number of months
\westep{In half a year = 6 months}
$Population = 821(1,02)^6 = 925$
\westep{In 10 years = 120 months}
$Population = 821(1,02)^{120} = 8~838$
\westep{in 100 years = 1~200 months}
$Population = 821(1,02)^{1~200} = 1,716 \times 10^{13}$\\
Note this answer is also given in scientific notation as it is a very big number.}
\end{wex}
