\label{p:m:m2d12}

\section{Introduction}
In Grade 10, we studied motion in one dimension and briefly looked at vertical motion. In this chapter we will discuss vertical motion and also look at motion in two dimensions. In Grade 11, we studied the conservation of momentum and looked at applications in one dimension. In this chapter we will look at momentum in two dimensions.

\section{Vertical Projectile Motion}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to understand and explain that for vertical projectile motion (near the surface of the Earth if air friction is ignored) projectiles
%\begin{itemize}
%\item fall freely with gravitational acceleration 'g' 
%\item accelerate downwards with a constant acceleration whether the projectile is moving upward or downward
%\item have zero velocity at their greatest height
%\item take the same the time to reach their greatest height from the point of upward launch as the time they take to fall back to the point of launch
%\item can have their motion described by a single set of equations for the upward and downward motion
%\end{itemize}
%\item The learner must be able to use equations of motion, e.g. to determine (1) the greatest height reached given the velocity with which the projectile is launched upward (initial velocity) (2) the time at which a projectile is at a particular height given its initial velocity (3) the height relative to the ground of the position of a projectile shot vertically upward at launch, given the time for the projectile to reach the ground
%\item The learner must be able to draw position vs time (x vs t), velocity vs time (v vs t) and acceleration vs time (a vs t) graphs for projectile motion 
%\item The learner must be able to give equations for position versus time and velocity versus time for the graphs of motion of particular projectiles and vice versa.
%\item Given x vs t, v vs t or a vs t graphs, the learner must be able to  (1) determine position, displacement, velocity or acceleration at any time t (2) describe the motion of the object e.g. graphs showing a ball, (a)	bouncing, (b) thrown vertically upwards (c) thrown vertically downward, and so on 
%\item Notes: Link to Grade 10 motion in one dimension. Link to Grade 11 Newton's second Law and the Law of Universal Gravitation. The equations of motion are identical to the equations introduced in Grade 10. Do not derive a special set of equations - use the general equations and set a=g for the vertical component of the motion.
%\end{syllabus}

In Grade 10, we studied the motion of objects in free fall and we saw that an object in free fall falls with gravitational acceleration $g$.
Now we can consider the motion of objects that are thrown upwards and then fall back to the Earth. We call this \textit{projectile motion} and we will only consider the situation where the object is thrown straight upwards and then falls straight downwards - this means that there is no horizontal displacement of the object, only a vertical displacement.

\subsection{Motion in a Gravitational Field}
When an object is in the earth's gravitational field, it always accelerates downwards, towards the centre of the earth, with a constant acceleration $g$, no matter whether the object is moving upwards or downwards. This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:p:m:m2d12:projectile}.

\Tip{Projectiles moving upwards or downwards in the earth's gravitational field always accelerate downwards with a constant acceleration $g$. Note: acceleration means that the velocity \textit{changes}; it either becomes greater \textit{or} smaller.}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

This means that if an object is moving upwards, its velocity decreases until it stops ($v_f=0$~\ms). This is the maximum height that the object reaches, because after this, the object starts to fall.

\Tip{Projectiles have zero velocity at their greatest height.}

\pagebreak[4]
Consider an object thrown upwards from a vertical height $h_o$. We have seen that the object will travel upwards with decreasing velocity until it stops, at which point it starts falling. The time that it takes for the object to fall down to height $h_o$ is the same as the time taken for the object to reach its maximum height from height $h_o$.

\Tip{Projectiles take the same time to go from the point of launch to the greatest height as the time they take to fall back to the point of launch.}

\subsection{Equations of Motion}
The equations of motion that were used in Chapter~\ref{p:gme10} to describe free fall can be used for projectile motion. These equations are the same as those equations that were derived in Chapter~\ref{p:m1d10}, but with acceleration from gravity: $a=g$. We use $g=9,8\emss$ for our calculations. 

Remember that when you use these equations, you are dealing with vectors which have magnitude \textit{and} direction. Therefore, you need to decide which direction will be the positive direction so that your vectors have the correct signs. 

\begin{eqnarray*}
v_i &=& \mbox{initial velocity (\ms) at $t$ = 0 s} \\
v_f &=& \mbox{final velocity (\ms) at time $t$}\\
\Delta x &=& \mbox{vertical displacement (m)} \\
t &=& \mbox{time (s)} \\
\Delta t &=& \mbox{time interval (s)} \\
g &=& \mbox{acceleration due to gravity (\mss)}
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray}
v_f &=& v_i + gt \label{eq:pg:eq1}\\
\Delta x &=& \frac{(v_i + v_f)}{2} t\label{eq:pg:eq2}\\
\Delta x &=& v_it + \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \label{eq:pg:eq3}\\
v_f^2 &=& v_i^2 + 2g\Delta x \label{eq:pg:eq4}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{wex}{Projectile motion}{A ball is thrown upwards with an initial velocity of 10~\ms. \begin{enumerate}
	\item Determine the maximum height reached above the thrower's hand.
	\item Determine the time it takes the ball to reach its maximum height.
	\end{enumerate}}
\newpage
{\westep{Identify what is required and what is given}
We are required to determine the maximum height reached by the ball and how long it takes to reach this height. We are given the initial velocity $v_i$ = 10 \ms and the acceleration due to gravity g = 9,8 \mss.

\westep{Determine how to approach the problem}
Choose down as positive. We know that at the maximum height the velocity of the ball is 0~\ms. We therefore have the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item{$v_i=-10\ems$ (it is negative because we chose downwards as positive)}
\item{$v_f=0\ems$}
\item{$g=+9,8\emss$}
\end{itemize}

\westep{Identify the appropriate equation to determine the height.}
We can use:
\nequ{v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2g \Delta x}
to solve for the height.

\westep{Substitute the values in and find the height.}
\begin{eqnarray*}
v_f^2 &=& v_i^2 + 2g\Delta x\\
(0)^{2} &=& (-10)^{2} + (2)(9,8)  (\Delta x)\\
-100 &=& 19,6 \Delta x\\
\Delta x &=& -5,102 \rm{m}
\end{eqnarray*}
The value for the displacement will be negative because the displacement is upwards and we have chosen downward as positive (and upward as negative). The height will be a positive number, $h=5,10$m.

\westep{Identify the appropriate equation to determine the time.}
We can use:
\nequ{v_f = v_i + gt}
to solve for the time.

\westep{Substitute the values in and find the time.}
\begin{eqnarray*}
v_f &=& v_i + gt\\
0  &=& -10 + 9,8t\\
10 &=& 9,8 t\\
t  &=& 1,02 \rm{s}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Write the final answer.}
The ball reaches a maximum height of 5,10 m.\\
The ball takes 1,02 s to reach the top.}
\end{wex}

\begin{wex}{Height of a projectile}{A cricketer hits a cricket ball from the ground so that it goes directly upwards. If the ball takes, 10~s to return to the ground, determine its maximum height.}{
\setcounter{stepcounter}{1}
\westep{Identify what is required and what is given}
We need to find how high the ball goes. We know that it takes 10 seconds to go up and down. We do not know what the initial velocity of the ball ($v_i$) is.\\
%We are required to determine the maximum height of a ball, thrown upwards, that takes 10~s to return to the ground.

\westep{Determine how to approach the problem}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
A problem like this one can be looked at as if there are two parts to the motion. The first is the ball going up with an initial velocity and stopping at the top (final velocity is zero). The second motion is the ball falling, its initial velocity is zero and its final velocity is unknown.\\

\vspace{1cm}

Choose down as positive. We know that at the maximum height, the velocity of the ball is 0 \ms. We also know that the ball takes the same time to reach its maximum height as it takes to travel from its maximum height to the ground. This time is half the total time. We therefore know the following for the second motion of the ball going down:
\begin{itemize}
\item{$t=5\es$, half of the total time}
\item{$v_{top}=v_i=0\ems$}
\item{$g=9,8\emss$}
\item{$\Delta x=$ ?}
\end{itemize}

\westep{Find an appropriate equation to use}
We do not know the final velocity of the ball coming down. We need to choose an equation that does not have $v_f$ in it. We can use the following equation to solve for $\Delta x$:
\nequ{\Delta x = v_it + \frac{1}{2}gt^2}

\westep{Substitute values and find the height.}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta x &=& (0)(5) + \frac{1}{2}(9,8)(5)^2\\
\Delta x &=& 0 + 122,5 \rm{m}\\
%\rm{height} &=& 122,5 \rm{m}
\end{eqnarray*}

In the second motion, the displacement of the ball is 122,5m downwards. This means that the height was 122,5m, h=122,5m.

\westep{Write the final answer}
The ball reaches a maximum height of 122,5 m.}

\subsection{Graphs of Vertical Projectile Motion}
Vertical projectile motion is the same as motion at constant acceleration. In Grade 10 you learned about the graphs for motion at constant acceleration. The graphs for vertical projectile motion are therefore identical to the graphs for motion under constant acceleration.\\
When we draw the graphs for vertical projectile motion, we consider two main situations: an object moving upwards and an object moving downwards.\\
If we take the upwards direction as positive then for an object moving upwards we get the graphs shown in Figure~\ref{fig:p:m:m2d12:pm:up}.

\westep{Graph of velocity vs. time}
The ball starts off with a velocity of +4,9 \ms at t = 0 s, it then reaches a velocity of 0 \ms at t = 0,5 s. It stops and falls back to the Earth. At t = 1,0s (i.e. after a further 0,5s) it has a velocity of -4,9 \ms. This is the same as the initial upwards velocity but it is downwards. It carries on at constant acceleration until t = 2,58 s. In other words, the velocity graph will be a straight line.
The final velocity of the ball can be calculated as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
v_f&=&v_i+g t\\
&=&0+(-9,8)(2,08...)\\
&=&-20,396... \ems

{\westep{Find the height of the window.}
The initial position of the ball will tell us how high the window is. From the y-axis on the graph we can see that the ball is 4 m from the ground.\\
The window is therefore 4 m above the ground.\\
\westep{Find the time taken to reach the maximum height.}
The maximum height is where the position-time graph show the maximum position - the top of the curve. This is when t = 0,2 s.\\
It takes the ball 0,2s to reach the maximum height.\\
\westep{Find the initial velocity ($v_i$) of the ball.}
To find the initial velocity we only look at the first part of the motion of the ball. That is from when the ball is released until it reaches its maximum height. We have the following for this: In this case, let's choose upwards as positive.
\begin{eqnarray*}
t &=& 0,2~\rm{s}\\
g &=& -9,8~\emss\\
v_f &=& 0~\ems \rm{(because~the~ball~stops)}
\end{eqnarray*}
To calculate the initial velocity of the ball ($v_i$), we use:
\begin{eqnarray*}
v_f &=& v_i + gt\\
0 &=& v_i + (-9,8)(0,2)\\
v_i &=& 1,96 \ems
\end{eqnarray*}
The initial velocity of the ball is 1,96 \ms upwards.\\

\westep{Find the maximum height ($\Delta x$) of the ball.}
To find the maximum height we look at the initial motion of the ball. We have the following:
\begin{eqnarray*}
t &=& 0,2~\rm{s}\\
g &=& -9,8~\emss\\
v_f &=& 0~\ems \rm{(because~the~ball~stops)}\\
v_i &=& +1,96 \ems \rm{(calculated~above)}
\end{eqnarray*}
To calculate the displacement from the window to the maximum height ($\Delta x$) we use:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta x &=& v_it + \frac{1}{2}gt^2\\
\Delta x &=& (1,96)(0,2) + \frac{1}{2}(-9,8)(0,2)^2\\
\Delta x &=& 0,196 \rm{m}\\
\end{eqnarray*}
The maximum height of the ball is (4 + 0,196) = 4,196 m above the ground.\\

\westep{Find the final velocity ($v_f$) of the ball.}
To find the final velocity of the ball we look at the second part of the motion. For this we have:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta x &=& -4,196~\rm{m} \rm~({because~upwards~is~positive})\\
g &=& -9,8~\emss\\
v_i &=& 0~\ems
\end{eqnarray*}
We can use $(v_f)^2 = (v_i)^2 + 2g\Delta x$ to calculate the final velocity of the ball.
\begin{eqnarray*}
(v_f)^2 &=& (v_i)^2 + 2g\Delta x\\
(v_f)^2 &=& (0)^2 + 2(-9,8)(-4,196)\\
(v_f)^2 &=& 82,2416\\
v_f &=& 9,0687 ... \ems\\
\end{eqnarray*}
The final velocity of the ball is 9,07 \ms \textit{downwards}.

{\westep{Describe the motion of the ball.}
We need to study the velocity-time graph to answer this question. We will break the motion of the ball up into two time zones: t = 0 s to t = 2 s and t = 2 s to t = 4 s.\\
From t = 0 s to t = 2 s the following happens:\\
The ball starts to move at an initial velocity of 19,6 \ms and decreases its velocity to 0 \ms at t = 2 s. 
At t = 2 s the velocity of the ball is 0 \ms and therefore it stops.\\
From t = 2 s to t = 4 s the following happens:\\
The ball moves from a velocity of 0 \ms to 19,6 \ms in the opposite direction to the original motion.\\
If we assume that the ball is hit straight up in the air (and we take upwards as positive), it reaches its maximum height at t = 2 s, stops, turns around and falls back to the Earth to reach the ground at t = 4 s.  \\

\westep{Draw the displacement-time graph.}
To draw this graph, we need to determine the displacements at t = 2 s and t = 4 s.\\
At t = 2 s: \\
The displacement is equal to the area under the graph:\\
Area under graph = Area of triangle\\
Area = $\frac{1}{2}$bh\\
Area = $\frac{1}{2}$ $\times$ 2 $\times$ 19,6\\
Displacement = 19,6 m

At t = 4 s: \\
The displacement is equal to the area under the whole graph (top and bottom). Remember that an area under the time line must be substracted:\\
Area under graph = Area of triangle 1 + Area of triangle 2\\
Area = $\frac{1}{2}$bh + $\frac{1}{2}$bh\\
Area = ($\frac{1}{2}$ $\times$ 2 $\times$ 19,6) + ($\frac{1}{2}$ $\times$ 2 $\times$ (-19,6))\\
Area = 19,6 - 19,6 \\
Displacement = 0 m

The displacement-time graph for motion at constant acceleration is a curve. The graph will look like this:\\

\westep{Draw the acceleration-time graph.}
To draw the acceleration vs. time graph, we need to know what the acceleration is. The velocity-time graph is a straight line which means that the acceleration is constant. The gradient of the line will give the acceleration.

The line has a negative slope (goes down towards the left) which means that the acceleration has a negative value.

Calculate the gradient of the line:\\
gradient = $\frac{\Delta v}{t}$\\
gradient = $\frac{0-19,6}{2-0}$\\
gradient = $\frac{-19,6}{2}$\\
gradient = -9,8\\
acceleration = 9,8 \mss downwards

%\Extension{Projectile Motion in Two Dimensions}{This section does not appear in the current syllabus, but appears in the %detailed notes we received from DJG. If there is time, then this section can be written up.
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item calculate the horizontal and vertical components of a projectile launched at an angle, $\theta$, to the horizontal
%\item Use the equations of motion to calculate displacement and velocity for the vertical component of projectile motion, %setting the acceleration equal to $g$
%\item use the equations of motion to calculate displacement and velocity for the horizontal component of projectile motion, %setting the acceleration equal to zero
%\item Use the equations of motion for the horizontal and vertical components of projectile motion to calculate the time taken %for the motion.
%\item Calculate the initial and final velocity from the horizontal and vertical components, i.e. calculate the magnitude and %angle relative to the horizontal.
%\item The equations of motion are identical to the equations introduced in Grade 10. Do not derive a special set of equations %- use the general equations and set a=g for the vertical component of the motion and a=0 for the horizontal component. Be %sure to select positive and negative directions, and make sure that the signs of the displacement, velocity and acceleration %are consistent with the directions you choose. The acceleration of gravity always points downwards. When the velocity has a %horizontal and a vertical component, the magnitude of the velocity can be obtained using Pythagoras theorem, %$v=sqrt(v1^2+vf^2)$ and the angle of elevation from theta = arctan(vy/vx)

\section{Conservation of Momentum in Two Dimensions}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must know that the momentum of a system is conserved when no external forces act on it
%\item The learner must be able to calculate x and y components of momentum
%\item The learner must be able to solve problems involving conservation of momentum in both the x direction and the y direction
%\item The learner must know that an external force causes the momentum to change. The impulse delivered by the force is $F\Delta t=\Delta p$. 
%\item The learner must be able to solve problems involving impulse and momentum when the applied force is in the horizontal or vertical direction.
%\item The learner must be able to distinguish between elastic and inelastic collisions.
%\item The learner must be able to solve problems involving elastic and inelastic collisions for objects moving parallel or at right angles to each other.
%\item Notes: Link to Grade 11 conservation of momentum. As before, use the equation:pi=pfexcept now use one equation for components in the x direction and one equation for components in the y directionLink to grade 11 impulse.Link to Grade 10 "kinetic energy" Traffic accidents provide a very good context for studying inelastic collisions.
%\end{syllabus}

We have seen in Grade 11 that the momentum of a system is conserved when there are no external forces acting on the system. Conversely, an external force causes a change in momentum $\Delta p$, with the impulse delivered by the force, $F$ acting for a time $\Delta t$ given by:
\nequ{\Delta p=F\cdot \Delta t}
The same principles that were studied in applying the conservation of momentum to problems in one dimension, can be applied to solving problems in two dimensions. 

The calculation of momentum is the same in two dimensions as in one dimension. The calculation of momentum in two dimensions is broken down into determining the $x$ and $y$ components of momentum and applying the conservation of momentum to each set of components. 

Consider two objects moving towards each other as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:p:m:m2d12:momentum:2deg}. We analyse this situation by calculating the $x$ and $y$ components of the momentum of each object.

The initial momentum is equal to the final momentum:

We also know that $m_{1}=m_{2}=90$ kg and $v_{f2}$ = 0 ms$^{-1}$. \\
We need to find the final velocity and angle at which Player 1 bounces off Player 2.

\westep{Use conservation of momentum to solve the problem. First find the initial total momentum:}
Total initial momentum = Total final momentum. 
But we have a two dimensional problem, and we need to break up the initial momentum into $x$ and $y$ components. 
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{ix} &=& p_{fx}\\
p_{iy} &=& p_{fy}
\end{eqnarray*}

For Player 1:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{ix1} &=& m_{1}v_{i1x} = 90 \times 0 = 0 \\
p_{iy1} &=& m_{1}v_{i1y} = 90 \times 5 
\end{eqnarray*}

For Player 2:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{ix2} &=& m_{2}v_{i2x} = 90 \times 8\times \sin{60^{\circ}} \\
p_{iy2} &=& m_{2}v_{i2y} = 90 \times 8\times \cos{60^{\circ}} 
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Now write down what we know about the final momentum:}
For Player 1:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{fx1} &=& m_{1}v_{fx1} = 90 \times v_{fx1}\\
p_{fy1} &=& m_{1}v_{fy1} = 90 \times v_{fy1}
\end{eqnarray*}

For Player 2:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{fx2} &=& m_{2}v_{fx2} = 90 \times 0 = 0 \\
p_{fy2} &=& m_{2}v_{fy2} = 90 \times 0 = 0
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Use conservation of momentum:}
The initial total momentum in the $x$ direction is equal to the final total momentum in the $x$ direction.\\
The initial total momentum in the $y$ direction is equal to the final total momentum in the $y$ direction.\\
If we find the final $x$ and $y$ components, then we can find the final $total$ momentum.

\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{ix1} + p_{ix2} &=& p_{fx1} + p_{fx2} \\
0 + 90 \times 8\times \sin{60^{\circ}} &=& 90 \times v_{fx1} + 0 \\
v_{fx1} &=& \frac{90 \times 8\times \sin{60^{\circ}} }{90} \\
v_{fx1} &=& 6.928 \rm{ms^{-1}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{iy1} + p_{iy2} &=& p_{fy1} + p_{fy2} \\
90\times 5 + 90\times 8\times \cos{60^{\circ}} &=& 90\times v_{fy1} + 0 \\
v_{fy1} &=& \frac{90\times 5 + 90\times 8\times \cos{60^{\circ}}}{90} \\
v_{fy1} &=& 9.0 \rm{ms^{-1}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Using the $x$ and $y$ components, calculate the final total $v$}
Use Pythagoras's theorem to find the total final velocity:

\begin{eqnarray*}
v_{ftot} &=& \sqrt{v_{fx1}^{2} + v_{fy1}^{2}}\\

&=& 11.36
\end{eqnarray*}

Calculate the angle $\theta$ to find the direction of Player 1's final velocity:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sin{\theta} &=& \frac{v_{fy1}}{v_{ftot}}\\
\theta &=& 52.4^{\circ}

We need to define a reference frame: For y, choose the direction they are both running in as positive. For x, the direction player 2 is running in is positive.

We also know that $m_{1}=m_{2}=80$ kg. And $v_{fx2}$=-0.3 ms$^{-1}$ and $v_{fy2}$=6 ms$^{-1}$. \\
We need to find the final velocity and angle at which Player 1 bounces off Player 2.

\westep{Use conservation of momentum to solve the problem. First find the initial total momentum:}
Total initial momentum = Total final momentum. 
But we have a two dimensional problem, and we need to break up the initial momentum into $x$ and $y$ components. Remember that momentum is a vector and has direction which we will indicate with a '+' or '-' sign.
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{ix} &=& p_{fx}\\
p_{iy} &=& p_{fy}
\end{eqnarray*}

For Player 1:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{ix1} &=& m_{1}v_{i1x} = 80 \times (-5) \times \cos{75^{\circ}} \\
p_{iy1} &=& m_{1}v_{i1y} = 80 \times 5 \times \sin{75^{\circ}}
\end{eqnarray*}

For Player 2:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{ix2} &=& m_{2}v_{i2x} = 80 \times 6\times \cos{60^{\circ}} \\
p_{iy2} &=& m_{2}v_{i2y} = 80 \times 6\times \sin{60^{\circ}} 
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Now write down what we know about the final momentum:}
For Player 1:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{fx1} &=& m_{1}v_{fx1} = 80 \times v_{fx1}\\
p_{fy1} &=& m_{1}v_{fy1} = 80 \times v_{fy1}
\end{eqnarray*}

For Player 2:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{fx2} &=& m_{2}v_{fx2} = 80 \times (-0.3) \\
p_{fy2} &=& m_{2}v_{fy2} = 80 \times 6 
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Use conservation of momentum:}
The initial total momentum in the $x$ direction is equal to the final total momentum in the $x$ direction.\\
The initial total momentum in the $y$ direction is equal to the final total momentum in the $y$ direction.\\
If we find the final $x$ and $y$ components, then we can find the final $total$ momentum.

\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{ix1} + p_{ix2} &=& p_{fx1} + p_{fx2} \\
-80 \times 5\cos{75^{\circ}} + 80 \times 6 \times \cos{60^{\circ}} &=& 80 \times v_{fx1} + 80\times(-0.3) \\
v_{fx1} &=& \frac{-80 \times 5\cos{75^{\circ}} + 80 \times 6 \times \cos{60^{\circ}} - 80\times(-0.3) }{80} \\
v_{fx1} &=& 2.0~ \rm{ms^{-1}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{iy1} + p_{iy2} &=& p_{fy1} + p_{fy2} \\
80\times 5\times \sin{75^{\circ}} + 80\times 6 \times \sin{60^{\circ}} &=& 80\times v_{fy1} + 80\times 6 \\
v_{fy1} &=& \frac{80\times 5\sin{75^{\circ}} + 80\times 6 \times \sin{60^{\circ}}-80\times 6}{80} \\
v_{fy1} &=& 4.0~ \rm{ms^{-1}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Using the $x$ and $y$ components, calculate the final total $v$}
Use Pythagoras's theorem to find the total final velocity:

\begin{eqnarray*}
v_{ftot} &=& \sqrt{v_{fx1}^{2} + v_{fy1}^{2}}\\
&=& \sqrt{2^{2} + 4^{2}} \\
&=& 4.5
\end{eqnarray*}

Calculate the angle $\theta$ to find the direction of Player 1's final velocity:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tan{\theta} &=& \frac{v_{fy1}}{v_{fx1}}\\
\theta &=& 63.4^{\circ}
\end{eqnarray*}

Therefore Player 1 bounces off Player 2 with a final velocity of 4.5 m$\cdot s^{-1}$ at an angle of 63.4$^\circ$ from the horizontal.

\section{Types of Collisions}
\label{pc:types}
Two types of collisions are of interest:

\begin{itemize}
\item elastic collisions
\item inelastic collisions
\end{itemize}

In both types of collision, total momentum is \emph{always} conserved. Kinetic energy is conserved for elastic collisions, but not for inelastic collisions.

\subsection{Elastic Collisions}

\Definition{Elastic Collisions}{An elastic collision is a collision where total momentum and total kinetic energy are both conserved.}

This means that in an elastic collision the total momentum \emph{and} the total kinetic energy before the collision is the same as after the collision. For these kinds of collisions, the kinetic energy is not changed into another type of energy.

\subsubsection{Before the Collision}
\label{pc:types:elast:before}
Figure~\ref{fig:pc:types:elast:before} shows two balls rolling toward each other, about to collide:
\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(0,0)(8,2)

\pscircle[fillstyle=crosshatch](0.5,1){.5}

\end{pspicture}
\caption{Two balls before they collide.}
\label{fig:pc:types:elast:before}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Before the balls collide, the total momentum of the system is equal to all the individual momenta added together. Ball 1 has a momentum which we call $p_{i1}$ and ball 2 has a momentum which we call $p_{i2}$, it means the total momentum before the collision is:

\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:pc:types:elast:before:P}
p_{i} = p_{i1}+p_{i2}
\end{equation*}
We calculate the total kinetic energy of the system in the same way. Ball 1 has a kinetic energy which we call $\kener_{i1}$ and the ball 2 has a kinetic energy which we call \kener$_{i2}$, it means that the total kinetic energy
before the collision is:
\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:pc:types:elast:before:K}
\kener_{i} = \kener_{i1}+\kener_{i2}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{After the Collision}
\label{pc:types:elast:after}
Figure~\ref{fig:pc:types:elast:after} shows two balls after they have collided:
\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(0,0)(8,2)
\pscircle[fillstyle=crosshatch](3.5,1){.5}
\rput*(3.5,1){1}
\psline{<-}(1,1)(3,1)
\rput(2,0.6){$p_{f1}$, $\kener_{f1}$}
\pscircle[fillstyle=hlines](4.5,1){0.5}
\rput*(4.5,1){2}
\psline{<-}(7,1)(5,1)
\rput(6, 0.6){$p_{f2}$, $\kener_{f2}$}
\end{pspicture}
\caption{Two balls after they collide.}
\label{fig:pc:types:elast:after}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

After the balls collide and bounce off each other, they have new momenta and new kinetic energies. Like before, the total momentum of the system is equal to all the individual momenta added together. Ball 1 now has a momentum
which we call $p_{f1}$ and ball 2 now has a momentum which we call $p_{f2}$, it means the total momentum after the collision is
\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:pc:types:elast:after:P}
p_{f} = p_{f1}+p_{f2}
\end{equation*}
Ball 1 now has a kinetic energy which we call $\kener_{f1}$ and ball 2 now has a kinetic energy which we call $\kener_{f2}$, it means that the total kinetic energy after the collision is:
\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:pc:types:elast:after:K}
\kener_{f} = \kener_{f1}+\kener_{f2}
\end{equation*}
Since this is an \emph{elastic} collision, the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision \textbf{and} the total kinetic energy before the collision equals the total kinetic energy after the collision. Therefore:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\nonumber
\mbox{Initial}&&\mbox{Final}\\
\label{eq:pc:types:elast:conserveP}
p_{i} &=& p_{f}\\\nonumber
p_{i1}+p_{i2} &=& p_{f1}+p_{f2} \\\nonumber
&\rm{\textbf{and}}&\\
\label{eq:pc:types:elast:conserveK}
\kener_{i} &=& \kener_{f} \\\nonumber
\kener_{i1}+\kener_{i2} &=& \kener_{f1}+\kener_{f2}
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{wex}{An Elastic Collision}{Consider a collision between two pool balls. Ball 1 is at rest and ball 2 is moving towards it with a speed of 2 \ms. The mass of each ball is 0.3 kg. After the balls collide \emph{elastically}, ball 2 comes to an immediate stop and ball 1 moves off. What is the final velocity of ball 1?}{

\westep{Determine how to approach the problem}

We are given:
\begin{itemize}
\item mass of ball 1, $m_1$ = 0.3 kg
\item mass of ball 2, $m_2$ = 0.3 kg
\item initial velocity of ball 1, $v_{i1}$ = 0 \ms
\item initial velocity of ball 2, $v_{i2}$ = 2 \ms
\item final velocity of ball 2, $v_{f2}$ = 0 \ms
\item the collision is elastic
\end{itemize}

All quantities are in SI units. We are required to determine the final velocity of ball 1, $v_{f1}$. Since the collision is elastic, we know that 
\begin{itemize}
\item momentum is conserved, $m_1v_{i1}+m_2v_{i2}=m_1v_{f1}+m_2v_{f2}$
\item energy is conserved, $\frac{1}{2}(m_1v_{i1}^2+m_2v_{i2}^2)=\frac{1}{2}(m_1v_{f1}^2+m_2v_{f2}^2)$

v_{f1}&=&2\ems

\begin{wex}{Another Elastic Collision}{Consider two 2 marbles. Marble 1 has mass 50~g and marble 2 has mass 100~g. Edward rolls marble 2 along the ground towards marble 1 in the positive $x$-direction. Marble 1 is initially at rest and marble 2 has a velocity of 3 \ms\ in the positive $x$-direction. After they collide \emph{elastically}, both marbles are moving. What is the final velocity of each marble?}
{\westep{Decide how to approach the problem}

We are given:
\begin{itemize}
\item mass of marble 1, $m_1$=50 g
\item mass of marble 2, $m_2$=100 g
\item initial velocity of marble 1, $v_{i1}$=0 \ms
\item initial velocity of marble 2, $v_{i2}$=3 \ms
\item the collision is elastic
\end{itemize}

The masses need to be converted to SI units.
\begin{eqnarray*}
m_{1} &=& 0,05\ \rm{kg}\\
m_{2} &=& 0,1\ \rm{kg}
\end{eqnarray*}

We are required to determine the final velocities:
\begin{itemize}
\item final velocity of marble 1, $v_{f1}$
\item final velocity of marble 2, $v_{f2}$
\end{itemize}

Since the collision is elastic, we know that
\begin{itemize}

\item momentum is conserved, $p_i=p_f$.
\item energy is conserved, $\kener_{i}$=$\kener_{f}$.
\end{itemize}

We have two equations and two unknowns ($v_1$, $v_2$) so it is a simple case of solving a set of simultaneous equations.

\westep{Solve the problem}

Momentum is conserved. Therefore:
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
p_{i}&=&p_{f}\nonumber\\
p_{i1}+p_{i2}&=&p_{f1}+p_{f2}\nonumber\\
m_{1}v_{i1} + m_{2}{v}_{i2} &=& m_{1}{v}_{f1}+m_{2}{v}_{f2}\nonumber\\
(0,05)(0)+(0,1)(3)&=&(0,05)v_{f1}+(0,1)v_{f2}\nonumber\\
0,3&=&0,05v_{f1}+0,1v_{f2}
\label{eq:wex1}
\end{eqnarray}
Energy is also conserved. Therefore:
\begin{eqnarray}
\kener_{i}&=&\kener_{f}\nonumber\\
\kener_{i1}+\kener_{i2}&=&\kener_{f1}+\kener_{f2}\nonumber \\
\frac{1}{2}m_{1}v_{i1}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_{2}{v}_{i2}^2 &=& \frac{1}{2}m_{1}{v}_{f1}^2+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}{v}_{f2}^2\nonumber\\
(\frac{1}{2})(0,05)(0)^2+(\frac{1}{2})(0,1)(3)^2&=&
\frac{1}{2}(0,05)(v_{f1})^2+(\frac{1}{2})(0,1)(v_{f2})^2\nonumber\\
0,45&=&0,025v_{f1}^2+0,05v_{f2}^2
\label{eq:wex2}
\end{eqnarray}

Substitute Equation~\ref{eq:wex1} into Equation~\ref{eq:wex2} and solve for $v_{f2}$.

\begin{eqnarray*}
m_{2}{v}_{i2}^2 &=& m_{1}{v}_{f1}^2+m_{2}{v}_{f2}^2\\
&=& m_{1} \left( \frac{m_2}{m_1}({v}_{i2} - {v}_{f2}) \right) ^2 +m_{2}{v}_{f2}^2\\
&=& m_{1} \frac{m_2^2}{m_1^2}\left({v}_{i2} - {v}_{f2} \right) ^2 +m_{2}{v}_{f2}^2\\
&=& \frac{m_2^2}{m_1}\left({v}_{i2} - {v}_{f2} \right) ^2 +m_{2}{v}_{f2}^2\\
{v}_{i2}^2&=& \frac{m_2}{m_1}\left({v}_{i2} - {v}_{f2} \right) ^2 +{v}_{f2}^2\\
&=&\frac{m_2}{m_1}\left({v}_{i2}^2 - 2\cdot v_{i2}\cdot v_{f2} + {v}_{f2}^2 \right) +{v}_{f2}^2\\
0&=&\left(\frac{m_2}{m_1}-1 \right){v}_{i2}^2 - 2 \frac{m_2}{m_1} v_{i2}\cdot v_{f2} + \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1}+1\right){v}_{f2}^2\\
&=&\left(\frac{0.1}{0.05}-1 \right)(3)^2 - 2 \frac{0.1}{0.05} (3)\cdot v_{f2} + \left(\frac{0.1}{0.05}+1\right){v}_{f2}^2\\
&=&(2-1)(3)^2 - 2 \cdot 2 (3)\cdot v_{f2} + (2+1){v}_{f2}^2\\
&=&9 - 12v_{f2} + 3{v}_{f2}^2\\
&=&3 - 4v_{f2} + {v}_{f2}^2\\
&=&(v_{f2}-3)(v_{f2}-1)
\end{eqnarray*}

Substituting back into Equation~\ref{eq:wex1}, we get:
\begin{eqnarray*}
{v}_{f1} &=& \frac{m_2}{m_1}({v}_{i2} - {v}_{f2})\\
&=& \frac{0.1}{0.05}(3 - 3)\\
&=&0\ \ems\\
&\mbox{or}&\\
{v}_{f1} &=& \frac{m_2}{m_1}({v}_{i2} - {v}_{f2})\\
&=& \frac{0.1}{0.05}(3 - 1)\\
&=&4\ \ems
\end{eqnarray*}
But according to the question, marble 1 is moving after the collision, therefore marble 1 moves to the right at 4 \ms.
Substituting this value for ${v}_{f1} $ into Equation~\ref{eq:wex1}, we can calculate:
\begin{eqnarray*}
v_{f2} & = &  \frac{0,3 - 0,05v_{f1}}{0,1} \\
& = & \frac{0,3 - 0,05\times4}{0,1} \\
& = & 1\ \ems
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore marble 2 moves to the right with a velocity of 1 \ms.

\westep{Decide how to approach the problem}
Since momentum is conserved in all kinds of collisions, we can use conservation of momentum to solve for the velocity of ball 2 after the collision.
\westep{Solve problem}

\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{before}&=&p_{after}\\
m_1v_{i1}+m_2v_{i2}&=&m_1v_{f1}+m_2v_{f2}\\
\left( \frac{150}{1000}\right) (2)+\left( \frac{150}{1000} \right)(-1,5) &=& \left( \frac{150}{1000} \right)(-1,5)+\left( \frac{150}{1000} \right)(v_{f2})\\
0,3-0,225&=&-0,225+0,15v_{f2}\\
v_{f2}&=&3\ems
\end{eqnarray*}

So after the collision, ball 2 moves with a velocity of $3\ems$.

\item {


The fact that characterises an elastic collision is that the total kinetic energy of the particles before the collision is the same as the total kinetic energy of the particles after the collision. This means that if we can show that the initial kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy, we have shown that the collision is elastic.

Calculating the initial total kinetic energy:

\begin{eqnarray*}
EK_{before}&=&\frac{1}{2}m_1v_{i1}^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2v_{i2}^2\\
&=&\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) (0,15)(2)^2+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0,15)(-1,5)^2\\
&=&0.469....J
\end{eqnarray*}

Calculating the final total kinetic energy:

\begin{eqnarray*}
EK_{after}&=&\frac{1}{2}m_1v_{f1}^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2v_{f2}^2\\
&=&\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0,15)(-1,5)^2+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) (0,15)(2)^2\\
&=&0.469....J
\end{eqnarray*}

So $EK_{before}=EK_{after}$ and hence the collision is elastic.

\subsection{Inelastic Collisions}
\Definition{Inelastic Collisions}{An inelastic collision is a collision in which \textbf{total momentum} is conserved but \textbf{total kinetic energy} is \emph{not} conserved. The kinetic energy is \emph{transformed} into other kinds of energy.}

So the total momentum before an inelastic collisions is the same as after the collision. But the total \emph{kinetic} energy before and after the inelastic collision is \emph{different}. Of course this does not mean that total energy has not been conserved, rather the energy has been \emph{transformed} into another type of energy.

As a rule of thumb, inelastic collisions happen when the colliding objects are distorted in some way. Usually they change their shape. The modification of the shape of an object requires energy and this is where the ``missing'' kinetic energy goes. A classic example of an inelastic collision is a motor car accident. The cars change shape and there is a noticeable change in the kinetic energy of the cars before and after the collision. This energy was used to bend the metal and deform the cars. Another example of an inelastic collision is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:p:m2d12:inelastic:example}.

\caption{Asteroid moving towards the Moon.}
\label{fig:p:m2d12:inelastic:example}
\end{figure}

An asteroid is moving through space towards the Moon. Before the asteroid crashes into the Moon, the total momentum of the system is:
\begin{equation*}
p_{i} = p_{im}+p_{ia}
\end{equation*}
The total kinetic energy of the system is:
\begin{equation*}
\kener_{i} = \kener_{im}+\kener_{ia}
\end{equation*}

When the asteroid collides \textbf{inelastically} with the Moon, its kinetic energy is transformed mostly into heat energy. If this heat energy is large enough, it can cause the asteroid and the area of the Moon's surface that it hits, to melt into liquid rock! From the force of impact of the asteroid, the molten rock flows outwards to form a crater on the Moon.

After the collision, the total momentum of the system will be the same as before. But since this collision is \emph{inelastic}, (and you can see that a change in the shape of objects has taken place!), total kinetic energy is \textbf{not} the same as before the collision.\\
Momentum is conserved:
\begin{equation*}
p_{i} = p_{f}
\end{equation*}
But the total kinetic energy of the system is not conserved:
\begin{equation*}
\kener_{i} \neq \kener_{f}
\end{equation*}

\westep{Determine how to approach the problem}
We are given:
\begin{itemize}
\item mass of car 1, $m_1$ = 500 kg
\item mass of car 2, $m_2$ = 500 kg
\item initial velocity of car 1, $v_{i1}$ = 0 \ms
\item initial velocity of car 2, $v_{i2}$ = 2 \ms to the left
\item the collision is inelastic
\end{itemize}

All quantities are in SI units. We are required to determine the final velocity of the resulting mass, $v_{f}$. 

Since the collision is inelastic, we know that
\begin{itemize}
\item momentum is conserved, $m_1v_{i1}+m_2v_{i2}=m_1v_{f1}+m_2v_{f2}$
\item kinetic energy is not conserved
\end{itemize}

\westep{Choose a frame of reference}
Choose to the left as positive.

\westep{Solve problem}
So we must use conservation of momentum to solve this problem. 

\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{i} & = & p_{f} \\
p_{i1} + p_{i2} &=& p_{f} \\
m_{1}v_{i1} + m_{2}v_{i2} &=& (m_{1} +m_{2})v_f \\
(500)(0) + (500)(2) &=& (500+500)v_f \\
1 000 &=& 1000 v_f \\
v_f &=& 1\ \ems
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, the final velocity of the resulting mass of cars is 1 \ms to the left.

\essaytitle[High Energy Collisions]
Take an orange and expand it to the size of the earth. The atoms of the
earth-sized orange would themselves be about the size of regular oranges and
would fill the entire ``earth-orange''. Now, take an atom and expand it to
the size of a football field. The nucleus of that atom would be about the
size of a tiny seed in the middle of the field. From this analogy, you can
see that atomic nuclei are very small objects by human standards. They are
roughly $10^{-15}$ meters in diameter -- one-hundred thousand times smaller
than a typical atom. These nuclei cannot be seen or studied via any
conventional means such as the naked eye or microscopes. So how do
scientists study the structure of very small objects like atomic nuclei?

The simplest nucleus, that of hydrogen, is called the proton. Faced with
the inability to isolate a single proton, open it up, and directly examine
what is inside, scientists must resort to a brute-force and somewhat
indirect means of exploration: high energy collisions. By colliding protons
with other particles (such as other protons or electrons) at very high
energies, one hopes to learn about what they are made of and how they work.
The American physicist Richard Feynman once compared this process to
slamming delicate watches together and figuring out how they work by only
examining the broken debris. While this analogy may seem pessimistic, with
sufficient mathematical models and experimental precision, considerable
information can be extracted from the debris of such high energy subatomic
collisions. One can learn about both the nature of the forces at work and
also about the sub-structure of such systems.

The experiments are in the category of ``high energy physics'' (also known
as ``subatomic'' physics). The primary tool of scientific exploration in
these experiments is an extremely violent collision between two very, very
small subatomic objects such as nuclei. As a general rule, the higher the
energy of the collisions, the more detail of the original system you are
able to resolve. These experiments are operated at laboratories such as
CERN, SLAC, BNL, and Fermilab, just to name a few. The giant machines that
perform the collisions are roughly the size of towns. For example, the RHIC
collider at BNL is a ring about 1 km in diameter and can be seen from space.
The newest machine currently being built, the LHC at CERN, is a ring 9 km in
diameter!}

\caption{Top view of a road with two people standing on opposite sides. A car drives past.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Consider two people standing, facing each other on either side of a road. A car drives past them, heading West. For the person facing South, the car was moving toward the right. However, for the person facing North, the car was moving toward the left. This discrepancy is due to the fact that the two people used two different \textit{frames of reference} from which to investigate this system. If each person were asked in what direction the car were moving, they would give a different answer. The answer would be relative to their frame of reference.

\subsection{What is a \textit{frame of reference}?}
\Definition{Frame of Reference}{
A \textit{frame of reference} is the point of view from which a system is observed.}
 In practical terms, a frame of reference is a set of axes (specifying directions) with an origin. An observer can then measure the position and motion of all points in a system, as well as the orientation of objects in the system relative to the frame of reference.

There are two types of reference frames: inertial and non-inertial. An inertial frame of reference travels at a constant velocity, which means that Newton's first law (inertia) holds true. A non-inertial frame of reference, such as a moving car or a rotating carousel, accelerates. Therefore, Newton's first law does not hold true in a non-inertial reference frame, as objects appear to accelerate without the appropriate forces.

\subsection{Why are frames of reference important?}
Frames of reference are important because (as we have seen in the introductory example) the velocity of a car can differ depending on which frame of reference is used.

\Extension{Frames of Reference and Special Relativity}{Frames of reference are especially important in special relativity, because when a frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light, then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another reference frame. The speed of light is considered to be the only true constant between moving frames of reference.}
The next worked example will explain this.
\subsection{Relative Velocity}
The velocity of an object is frame dependent. More specifically, the perceived velocity of an object depends on the velocity of the observer. For example, a person standing on shore would observe the velocity of a boat to be different than a passenger on the boat. 

\begin{wex}{Relative Velocity}{The speedometer of a motor boat reads 5 \ms. The boat is moving East across a river which has a current traveling 3 \ms\ North. What would the velocity of the motor boat be according to an observer on the shore?}

The observer on the shore sees the boat moving with a velocity of 5,8 \ms\ at 59,04$\degree$east of north due to the current pushing the boat perpendicular to its velocity. This is contrary to the perspective of a passenger on the boat who perceives the velocity of the boat to be 5 \ms\ due East. Both perspectives are correct as long as the frame of the observer is considered.}\end{wex}

\begin{wex}{Relative Velocity 2}{It takes a man 10 seconds to ride down an escalator. It takes the same man 15 s to walk back up the escalator against its motion. How long will it take the man to walk down the escalator at the same rate he was walking before?}
{\westep{Identify what is required and what is given}
We are required to determine the time taken for a man to walk down an escalator, with its motion.

We are given the time taken for the man to ride down the escalator and the time taken for the man to walk up the escalator, against it motion.

\westep{Determine how to approach the problem}
Select down as positive and assume that the escalator moves at a velocity $v_e$. If the distance of the escalator is $x_e$ then:
\equ{v_e=\frac{x_e}{10\es}}{eq:we1}
Now, assume that the man walks at a velocity $v_m$. Then we have that:
\equ{v_e-v_m=\frac{x_e}{15\es}}{eq:we2}
We are required to find $t$ in:
\equ{v_e+v_m=\frac{x_e}{t}}{eq:we3}

\westep{Solve the problem}
We find that we have three equations and three unknowns ($v_e$, $v_m$ and $t$).

Add (\ref{eq:we2}) to (\ref{eq:we3}) to get:
\nequ{2v_e=\frac{x_e}{15\es}+\frac{x_e}{t}}
Substitute from (\ref{eq:we1}) to get:
\nequ{2\frac{x_e}{10\es}=\frac{x_e}{15\es}+\frac{x_e}{t}}
Since $x_e$ is not equal to zero we can divide throughout by $x_e$.
\nequ{\frac{2}{10\es}=\frac{1}{15\es}+\frac{1}{t}}
Re-write:
\nequ{\frac{2}{10\es}-\frac{1}{15\es}=\frac{1}{t}}
Multiply by $t$:
\nequ{t(\frac{2}{10\es}-\frac{1}{15\es})=1}
Solve for $t$:

\nequ{t=\frac{1}{\frac{2}{10\es}-\frac{1}{15\es}}}
to get:
\nequ{t=\frac{15}{2}\es}
\westep{Write the final answer}
The man will take 15/2 = 7,5 s

\section{Summary}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Projectiles are objects that move through the air.
\item Objects that move up and down (vertical projectiles) on the earth accelerate with a constant acceleration g which is approximately equal to 9,8 \mss directed downwards towards the centre of the earth.
\item The equations of motion can be used to solve vertical projectile problems.
\begin{eqnarray*}
v_f &=& v_i + gt \\
\Delta x &=& \frac{(v_i + v_f)}{2} t\\
\Delta x &=& v_it + \frac{1}{2}gt^2\\
v_f^2 &=& v_i^2 + 2g\Delta x
\end{eqnarray*}
\item Graphs can be drawn for vertical projectile motion and are similar to the graphs for motion at constant acceleration. If upwards is taken as positive the $\Delta x$ vs $t$, $v$ vs $t$ ans $a$ vs $t$ graphs for an object being thrown upwards look like this:

\chapter{Mechanical Properties of Matter - Grade 12}
\label{p:mm:ep12}

\section {Introduction}

In this chapter we will look at some mechanical (physical) properties of various materials that we use. The mechanical properties of a material are those properties that are affected by forces being applied to the material. These properties are important to consider when we are constructing buildings, structures or modes of transport like an aeroplane.
  
\section{Deformation of materials}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to Appreciate that deformation is caused by a force that can either be compressive or tensile when applied in 1 plane
%\item The learner must be able to Describe behaviour of a spring in terms of the relationship between applied force and extension of a spring [Hooke's Law].
%\item The learner must be able to Demonstrate an understanding of the similarities and differences between force-extension graphs for typical ductile, brittle and polymeric materials 
%\item The learner must be able to Recognize the point of ultimate tensile stress and the point beyond which permanent deformation takes place (elastic limit) and the point beyond which Hooke's Law is no longer obeyed (Limit of proportionality)
%\end{syllabus}

\subsection{Hooke's Law}

Deformation (change of shape) of a solid is caused by a force that can either be compressive or tensile when applied in one direction (plane). Compressive forces try to compress the object (make it smaller or more compact) while tensile forces try to tear it apart.
We can study these effects by looking at what happens when you compress or expand a spring.
 
Hooke's Law relates the restoring force of a spring to its displacement from equilibrium length.

The equilibrium length of a spring is its length when no forces are applied to it. When a force is applied to a spring, e.g., by attaching a weight to one end, the spring will expand and become longer. The difference between the new length and the equilibrium length is the displacement.
 
\HistoricalNote{Hooke's Law}{Hooke's law is named after the seventeenth century physicist Robert Hooke who discovered it in 1660 (18 July 1635 - 3 March 1703).}

\Definition{Hooke's Law}{In an elastic spring, the extension varies linearly with the force applied.

$F=-kx$ \\
where $F$ is the restoring force in newtons (N), $k$ is the spring constant in $N \cdot m^{-1}$ and $x$ is the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium length in metres (m).}

\Activity{Experiment}{Hooke's Law}
{
\Aim{Verify Hooke's Law.}
\Apparatus{
\begin{itemize}
\item weights
\item spring
\item ruler
\end{itemize}
}
\Method{
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set up a spring vertically in such a way that you are able to hang weights from it. 
\item Measure the equilibrium length, $x_{0}$, of the spring (i.e. the length of the spring when nothing is attached to it).
\item Measure the extension of the spring for a range of different weights. Note: the extension is the difference between the spring's equilibrium length and the new length when a weight is attached to it, $x-x_{0}$. 
\item Draw a table of force (weight) in newtons and corresponding extension.
\item Draw a graph of force versus extension for your experiment. 
\end{enumerate}
 }
\Conclusions{
\begin{enumerate}
\item What do you observe about the relationship between the applied force and the extension?
\item Determine the gradient (slope) of the graph.
\item Now calculate the spring constant for your spring.
\end{enumerate} }
}

\begin{wex}{Hooke's Law I}{
A spring is extended by 7 cm by a force of 56 N.\\
Calculate the spring constant for this spring.
}

{
\begin{eqnarray*}
\textrm{F} &=& -\textrm{kx}\\
56 & = & -\textrm{k}\times0,07\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\textrm{k} &=& \frac{-56}{0,07}\\
 & = & -800\textrm{ N}\cdot \rm{m}^{-1}
\end{eqnarray*}
}

\end{wex}

\begin{wex}{Hooke's Law II}{
A spring of length 20cm stretches to 24cm when a load of 0,6N is applied to it.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the spring constant for the spring.\\

\item Determine the extension of the spring if a load of 0,5N is applied to it.\\

\end{enumerate}

}

{
\westep{Determine what information you have:}
We know: \\
$F$ = 0,6 N \\
The equilibrium spring length is 20 cm \\
The expanded spring length is 24 cm \\

\westep{Use Hooke's Law to find the spring constant}
First we need to calculate the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium length: \\
\begin{eqnarray*}
x & = & 24 \textrm{ cm} - 20 \textrm{ cm}\\
& = & 4 \textrm{ cm}\\
& = & 0,04 \textrm{ m}
\end{eqnarray*}

Now use Hooke's Law to find the spring constant: \\
\begin{eqnarray*}
F & = & -kx \\
0,6 & = & -k \cdot \: 0,04\\
k = -15  \textrm{ N.m}^{-1}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{The second part of the question asks us to find the spring's extension if a 0,5 N load is attached to it. We have:}
$F$ = 0,5 N \\
We know from the first part of the question that \\
$k$ = -15 $\textrm{ N.m}^{-1}$ \\

So, using Hooke's Law: \\

\begin{eqnarray*}
F & = & -kx \\
x & = & -\frac{F}{k} \\
& = & -\frac{0,5}{-15}\\
& = & 0,033 \textrm{ m}\\
& = & 3,3 \textrm{ cm}\\
\end{eqnarray*}
}

\end{wex}

\begin{wex}{Hooke's Law III}{
A spring has a spring constant of $-400$ N.m$^{-1}$. By how much will it stretch if a load of 50 N is applied to it?
}


{
\begin{eqnarray*}
\textrm{F} &=& -\textrm{kx}\\
50 & = & -(-400)\textrm{x}\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\textrm{x} &=& \frac{50}{400}\\
 & = & 0,125\textrm{ m}\\
& =& 12,5 \textrm{ cm}
\end{eqnarray*}
}
\end{wex}



\subsection{Deviation from Hooke's Law}

We know that if you have a small spring and you pull it apart too much it stops 'working'. It bends out of shape and loses its springiness. When this happens, Hooke's Law no longer applies, the spring's behaviour deviates from Hooke's Law.

Depending on what type of material we are dealing with, the manner in which it deviates from Hooke's Law is different. We give classify materials by this deviation. The following graphs show the relationship between force and extension for different materials and they all deviate from Hooke's Law. Remember that a straight line show proportionality so as soon as the graph is no longer a straight line, Hooke's Law no longer applies.

\subsubsection{Brittle material}

\end{figure}


This graph shows the relationship between force and extension for a brittle, but strong material. Note that there is very little extension for a large force but then the material suddenly fractures.
Brittleness is the property of a material that makes it break easily without bending. 

Have you ever dropped something made of glass and seen it shatter? Glass does this because it is brittle.

\subsubsection{Plastic material}

}
\caption{A plastic material's response to an applied force.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Here the graph shows the relationship between force and extension for a plastic material. The material extends under a small force but it does not fracture easily, and it does not return to its original length when the force is removed.


\subsubsection{Ductile material}

\end{pspicture} 
}

\caption{A ductile substance.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In this graph the relationship between force and extension is for a material that is ductile. The material shows plastic behaviour over a range of forces before the material finally fractures. Ductility is the ability of a material to be stretched into a new shape without breaking. Ductility is one of the characteristic properties of metals.

A good example of this is aluminium, many things are made of aluminium. Aluminium is used for making everything from cooldrink cans to aeroplane parts and even engine blocks for cars. Think about squashing and bending a cooldrink can.

Brittleness is the opposite of ductility.


 
When a material reaches a point where Hooke's Law is no longer valid, we say it has reached its \emph{limit of proportionality}. After this point, the material will not return to its original shape after the force has been removed. We say it has reached its \emph{elastic limit}.

\Definition{Elastic limit}{The elastic limit is the point beyond which permanent deformation takes place.}

\Definition{Limit of proportionality}{The limit of proportionality is the point beyond which Hooke's Law is no longer obeyed.}

\section{Elasticity, plasticity, fracture, creep}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to Compare and contrast elastic and plastic deformation
%\item The learner must be able to Compare and contrast creep and fracture as modes of failure in materials.
%\end{syllabus}

\subsection{Elasticity and plasticity}

Materials are classified as plastic or elastic depending on how they respond to an applied force. It is important to note that plastic substances are not necessarily a type of plastic (polymer) they only behave like plastic. Think of them as being like plastic which you will be familiar with.

A rubber band is a material that has elasticity. It returns to its original shape after an applied force is removed, providing that the material is not stretched beyond its elastic limit.

Plasticine is an example of a material that is plastic. If you flatten a ball of plasticine, it will stay flat. A plastic material does not return to its original shape after an applied force is removed.

\begin{itemize}
\item Elastic materials return to their original shape.
\item Plastic materials deform easily and do not return to their original shape.
\end{itemize}

\subsection {Fracture, creep and fatigue}

Some materials are neither plastic nor elastic. These substances will break or fracture when a large enough force is applied to them. The brittle glass we mentioned earlier is an example.
 
Creep occurs when a material deforms over a long period of time because of an applied force. An example of creep is the bending of a shelf over time when a heavy object is put on it. Creep may eventually lead to the material fracturing. The application of heat may lead to an increase in creep in a material.

Fatigue is similar to creep. The difference between the two is that fatigue results from the force being applied and then removed repeatedly over a period of time. With metals this results in failure because of metal fatigue. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Fracture is an abrupt breaking of the material.
\item Creep is a slow deformation process due to a continuous force over a long time.
\item Fatigue is weakening of the material due to short forces acting many many times.
\end{itemize}

\Exercise{Elasticity, plasticity, fracture and creep}{
\begin{enumerate}
\item List the similarities and differences between elastic and plastic deformation.
\item List the similarities and differences between creep and fracture as modes of failure in material.
\end{enumerate}}

\section{Failure and strength of materials}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to Compare and contrast the brittle and ductile modes of failure
%\item The learner must be able to Explain the behaviour and properties of materials by using an understanding of structure of materials. Terms should include vacancies, dislocations, impurities, and terms like grain boundaries and slip planes
%\item The learner must be able to Understand that a material's mechanical properties can be described in terms of ductile, malleable, tough and elastic.
%\item The learner must be able to Demonstrate understanding of how a material's mechanical properties can be controlled by cold working, annealing, tempering, and introduction of impurities, alloying and sintering.
%\end{syllabus}

\subsection{The properties of matter}

The strength of a material is defined as the stress (the force per unit cross-sectional area) that it can withstand. Strength is measured in newtons per square metre ($N \cdot m^{-2}$).

\emph{Stiffness} is a measure of how flexible a material is. In Science we measure the stiffness of a material by calculating its Young's Modulus. The Young's modulus is a ratio of how much it bends to the load applied to it. Stiffness is measure in newtons per metre ($N \cdot m^{-1}$).
 
\emph{Hardness} of a material can be measured by determining what force will cause a permanent deformation in the material. Hardness can also be measured using a scale like Mohs hardness scale. On this scale, diamond is the hardest at 10 and talc is the softest at 1.

\begin{IFact}{Remembering that the Mohs scale is the hardness scale and that the softest substance is talc will often come in handy for general knowledge quizes.}\end{IFact}

The \emph{toughness} of a material is a measure of how it can resist breaking when it is stressed. It is scientifically defined as the amount of energy that a material can absorb before fracturing.

A ductile material is a substance that can undergo large plastic deformation without fracturing. Many metals are very ductile and they can be drawn into wires, e.g. copper, silver, aluminium and gold.

A \emph{malleable} material is a substance that can easily undergo plastic deformation by hammering or rolling. Again, metals are malleable substances, e.g. copper can be hammered into sheets and aluminium can be rolled into aluminium foil.
 
A brittle material fractures with very little or no plastic deformation. Glassware and ceramics are brittle.

\subsection{Structure and failure of materials}

Many substances fail because they have a weakness in their atomic structure. There are a number of problems that can cause these weaknesses in structure. These are vacancies, dislocations, grain boundaries and impurities.

\emph{Vacancies} occur when there are spaces in the structure of a crystalline solid. These vacancies cause weakness and such materials often fail at these places. Think about bricks in a wall, if you started removing bricks the wall would get weaker.

\emph{Dislocations} result in weakened bonding between layers of atoms in a crystal lattice and this creates a critical boundary. If sufficient force is applied along the boundary, it can break the weakened bonds, allowing the two sides of the crystal to slide against one another. The two pieces of the crystal keep their shape and structure.

\emph{Impurities} in a crystal structure can cause a weak region in the crystal lattice around the impurity. Like vacancies, the substance often fail from these places in the lattice. This you can think of as bricks in a wall which don't fit properly, they are the wrong kind of bricks (atoms) to make the structure strong.

%A difference in \emph{grain size} in a crystal lattice will result in rusting or oxidation at the boundary which again will result in failure when sufficient force is applied. 

\subsection{Controlling the properties of materials}

There are a number of processes that can be used to make materials less likely to fail. We shall look at a few methods in this section.
\subsection*{Cold working}

Cold working is a process in which a metal is \emph{strengthened} by repeatedly being reshaped. This is carried out at a temperature below the melting point of the metal. The repeated shaping of the metal results in dislocations which then prevent restrict the motion of dislocations in the metal. Cold working increases the strength of the metal but in so doing, the metal loses its ductility. We say the metal is \emph{work-hardened}.\\

\subsection*{Annealing}
Annealing is a process of heating and cooling a material to relax the crystal structure and reduce weakness due to impurities and structural flaws. 
During annealing, the material is heated to a high temperature that is below the material's melting point. At a sufficiently high temperature, atoms with weakened bonds can rearrange themselves into a stronger structure. Slowly cooling the material ensures that the atoms will remain in these stronger locations. Annealing is often used before cold working. 
 
\subsection*{Introduction of Impurities}
Most pure metals are relatively weak because dislocations can move easily within them. However, if impurities are added to a metal (e.g., carbon is added to an iron sample), they can disturb the regular structure of the metal and so prevent dislocations from spreading. This makes the metal stronger. 
 
\subsection*{Alloying}
An alloy is a mixture of a metal with other substances. In other words, alloying involves adding impurities to a metal sample. The other substances can be metal or non-metal. An alloy often has properties that are very different to the properties of the substances from which it is made. The added substances strengthen the metal by preventing dislocations from spreading. Ordinary steel is an alloy of iron and carbon. The carbon impurities trap dislocations. There are many types of steel that also include other metals with iron and carbon. Brass is an alloy of copper and Zinc. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. Gold and silver that is used in coins or jewellery are also alloyed.

\subsection*{Tempering}

Tempering is a process in which a metal is melted then quickly cooled. The rapid cooling is called quenching. Usually tempering is done a number of times before a metal has the correct properties that are needed for a particular application. 

\subsection*{Sintering}

Sintering is used for making ceramic objects among other things. In this process the substance is heated so that its particles stick together. It is used with substances that have a very high melting point. The resulting product is often very pure and it is formed in the process into the shape that is wanted. Unfortunately, sintered products are brittle.

\subsection{Steps of Roman Swordsmithing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Purifying the iron ore. 
\item Heating the iron blocks in a furnace with charcoal. 
\item Hammering and getting into the needed shape. The smith used a hammer to pound the metal into blade shape. He usually used tongs to hold the iron block in place. 
\item Reheating. When the blade cooled, the smith reheated it to keep it workable. While reheated and hammered repeatedly.
\item \emph{Quenching} which involved the process of white heating and cooling in water. Quenching made the blade harder and stronger. At the same time it made the blade quite brittle, which was a considerable problem for the sword smiths.
\item \emph{Tempering} was then done to avoid brittleness the blade was tempered. In another words it was reheated a final time to a very specific temperature. How the Romans do balanced the temperature? The smith was guided only by the blade's color and his own experience.

\chapter{Work, Energy and Power - Grade 12}
\label{p:m:wpe12}

%\nts{Status:  Content is complete. More exercises, worked examples and activities are needed.}

\section{Introduction}
Imagine a vendor carrying a basket of vegetables on her head. Is she doing any work? One would definitely say yes! However, in Physics she is not doing any work! Again, imagine a boy pushing against a wall? Is he doing any work? We can see that his muscles are contracting and expanding. He may even be sweating. But in Physics, he is not doing any work!

If the vendor is carrying a very heavy load for a long distance, we would say she has lot of energy. By this, we mean that she has a lot of stamina. If a car can travel very fast, we describe the car as powerful. So, there is a link between power and speed. However, power means something different in Physics. This chapter describes the links between work, energy and power and what these mean in Physics.

You will learn that work and energy are closely related. You shall see that the energy of an object is its capacity to do work and doing work is the process of transferring energy from one object or form to another. In other
words,

\begin{itemize}
\item{an object with lots of energy can do lots of work.}
\item{when work is done, energy is lost by the object doing work and gained by the object on which the work is done.}
\end{itemize}

Lifting objects or throwing them requires that you do work on them. Even making electricity flow requires that something do work. Something must have energy and transfer it through doing work to make things happen.

\section{Work}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item when a force exerted on an object causes it to move, work is done on the object (except if the force and displacement are at right angles to each other)
%The learner should be able to:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Define the work done on an object by a force
%\item Give examples of when an applied force does and does not do work on an object
%\item Calculate the work done by an object when a force $F$ applied at angle $\theta$ to the direction of motion causes the object to move a distance $d$, using $W=F\cdot d \cos \theta$
%\item Notes:  Link to Grade 11 forces. Stress the difference between the everyday use of the word "work" and the physics use. Only the component of the applied force that is parallel to the motion does work on an object. So, for example, a person holding up a heavy book does no work on the book.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{syllabus}

\Definition{Work}{When a force exerted on an object causes it to move, work is done on the object (except if the force and displacement are at right angles to each other).}

This means that in order for work to be done, an object must be moved a distance $d$ by a force $F$, such that there is some non-zero component of the force in the direction of the displacement. Work is calculated as:
\equ{W=F\cdot \Delta x \cos \theta.}{eq:wpeg12:workgeneral}
where $F$ is the applied force, $\Delta x$ is the displacement of the object and $\theta$ is the angle between the applied force and the direction of motion.

\end{pspicture}
\caption{The force $F$ causes the object to be displaced by $\Delta x$ at angle $\theta$.}
\label{fig:wpe12:wgeneral}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

It is very important to note that for work to be done there must be a component of the applied force in the direction of motion. Forces perpendicular to the direction of motion do no work.

For example work is done on the object in Figure~\ref{fig:wpe12:wparallel},

\end{figure}

\Activity{Investigation}{Is work done?}{Decide whether on not work is done in the following situations. Remember that for work to be done a force must be applied in the direction of motion and there must be a displacement. Give reasons for your answer.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Max pushes against a wall and becomes tired.}
\item{A book falls off a table and free falls to the ground.}
\item{A rocket accelerates through space.}
\item{A waiter holds a tray full of meals above his head with one arm and carries it straight across the room at constant speed. (Careful! This is a tricky question.)}
\end{enumerate}}

\Tip{\textbf{The Meaning of $\theta$:} The angle $\theta$ is the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector. In the following situations, $\theta=0^{\circ}$.

\end{center}}

As with all physical quantities, work must have units. Following from the definition, work is measured in N$\cdot$m. The name given to this combination of S.I. units is the joule (symbol J).

\Definition{Joule}{1 joule is the work done when an object is moved 1~m under the application of a force of 1~N in the direction of motion.}

The work done by an object can be positive or negative. Since force ($F_{\|}$) and displacement ($s$) are both vectors, the result of the above equation depends on their directions:

\begin{itemize}
\item{If $F_{\|}$ acts in the same direction as the motion then positive work is being done. In this case the object on which the force is applied gains energy.}
\item{If the direction of motion and $F_{\|}$ are opposite, then negative
work is being done. This means that energy is transferred in the opposite direction. For example, if you try to push a car uphill by applying a force up the slope and instead the car rolls down the hill you are doing negative work on the car. Alternatively, the car is doing positive work on you!}
\end{itemize}

\Tip{The everyday use of the word "work" differs from the physics use. In physics, only the component of the applied force that is parallel to the motion does work on an object. So, for example, a person holding up a heavy book does no work on the book.}

\begin{wex}{Calculating Work Done I}{If you push a box 20~m forward by applying a force of 15~N in the forward direction, what is the work you have done on the box?}
{\westep{Analyse the question to determine what
information is provided}
\begin{itemize}
\item The force applied is $F$=15~N.
\item The distance moved is $s$=20~m.
\item The applied force and distance moved are in the same
direction. Therefore, $F_{\|}$=15~N.
\end{itemize}
These quantities are all in the correct units, so no unit conversions
are required.

\westep{Analyse the question to determine what is being asked}
\begin{itemize}
\item We are asked to find the work done on the box. We know from the
definition that work done is $W=F_{\|}s$
\end{itemize}

\westep{Next we substitute the values and calculate the work done}

\begin{eqnarray*}
W&=&F_{\|} s\\
&=& (15\ \eN)(20\ \emm)\\
&=& 300\ \rm{J}
\end{eqnarray*}

Remember that the answer must be {\em positive} as the applied force and the motion are in the same direction (forwards). In this case, you (the pusher) lose energy, while the box gains energy.}
\end{wex}

\begin{wex}{Calculating Work Done II}{What is the work done by you on a car, if you try to push the car up a hill by applying a force of 40~N directed up the slope, but it slides downhill 30~cm?}
{\westep{Analyse the question to determine what
information is provided}
\begin{itemize}
\item The force applied is $F$=40~N
\item The distance moved is $s$=30~cm. This is expressed in the wrong units
so we must convert to the proper S.I. units (meters):
\begin{eqnarray*}
100\,\rm{cm}&=&1\emm\\
1\,\rm{cm}&=&\frac{1}{100}\emm\\
\therefore 30 \times 1\,\rm{cm}&=&30 \times \frac{1}{100}\emm\\
&=& \frac{30}{100}\emm\\
&=& 0,3\emm
\end{eqnarray*}
\item The applied force and distance moved are in opposite directions.  Therefore, if we take $s$=0.3~m, then $F_{\|}$=-40~N.
\end{itemize}
\westep{Analyse the question to determine what is being asked}
\begin{itemize}
\item We are asked to find the work done on the car by you. We know
that work done is $W=F_{\|}s$
\end{itemize}

\westep{Substitute the values and calculate the work done}
Again we have the applied force and the distance moved so we can proceed with calculating the work done:
\begin{eqnarray*}
W&=&F_{\|} s\\
&=& (-40\eN)(0.3\emm)\\
&=& -12\rm{J}
\end{eqnarray*}
Note that the answer must be {\em negative} as the applied force and the motion are in opposite directions. In this case the car does work on the person trying to push.}
\end{wex}

What happens when the applied force and the motion are not parallel? If there is an angle between the direction of motion and the applied force then
to determine the work done we have to calculate the {\em component} of
the applied force {\em parallel} to the direction of motion. Note that this
means a force perpendicular to the direction of motion can do no work.

\begin{wex}{Calculating Work Done III}{Calculate the work done on a box, if it is pulled 5~m along the ground by applying a force of $F$=10~N at an angle of $60^{\circ}$ to the horizontal.

\end{center}}

{\westep{Analyse the question to determine what
information is provided}
\begin{itemize}
\item The force applied is $F$=10~N
\item The distance moved is $s$=5~m along the ground
\item The angle between the applied force and the motion is $60^{\circ}$
\end{itemize}
These quantities are in the correct units so we do not need to perform
any unit conversions.

\westep{Analyse the question to determine what is being asked}
\begin{itemize}
\item We are asked to find the work done on the box.
\end{itemize}

\westep{Calculate the component of the applied force in the direction of motion}

Since the force and the motion are not in the same direction, we must
first calculate the component of the force in the direction of the
motion.

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(0,0)(2,2.5)
%\psgrid
\psline{-}(0,0)(0,0.5)\psline{-}(0,0.5)(0.5,0.5)

\rput(1,2.1){$F$}\rput(1,0.25){$F_{||}$}
\rput(1.75,1.5){$F_{\|}$}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

From the force diagram we see that the component of the applied force
parallel to the ground is
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{||}&=&F\cdot \cos(60^{\circ})\\
&=& 10\eN\cdot \cos(60^{\circ})\\
&=& 5\eN
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Substitute and calculate the work done}
Now we can calculate the work done on the box:
\begin{eqnarray*}
W&=&F_{\|} s\\
&=& (5\eN)(5\emm) \\
&=& 25\eJ
\end{eqnarray*}
Note that the answer is positive as the component of the force $F_{\|}$ is in the same direction as the motion.}

\section{Energy}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item the work done by an external force on an object/system equals the change in mechanical energy of the object/system
%The learner should be able to:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Know that an object with larger potential energy has a greater capacity to do work
%\item Solve problems using the work energy theorem, i.e. the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy: W = DEk = Ekf - Eki 
%\item Notes: Link to grade 10:	 conservation of energy. Give examples showing that objects with greater potential energy can do more work, e.g. a hammer dropped from a greater height can do more work than one dropped from a lower height. NOTE: a force only does work on an object if it stays in contact with the object. For example, a person pushing a trolley does work on the trolley, but the road does no work on the tyres of a car if they turn without slipping (the force is not applied over any distance because a different piece of tyre touches the road every instant).

\subsection{External and Internal Forces}
In Grade 10, you saw that mechanical energy was conserved in the absence of external forces. It is important to know whether a force is an internal force or an external force in the system, because this is related to whether the force can change an object's total mechanical energy when it does work on an object. 

When an external force (for example friction, air resistance, applied force) does work on an object, the total mechanical energy (KE + PE) of that object changes. If positive work is done, then the object will gain energy. If negative work is done, then the object will lose energy. The gain or loss in energy can be in the form of potential energy, kinetic energy, or both. However, the work which is done is equal to the change in mechanical energy of the object.

\Activity{Investigations}{External Forces}

We can investigate the effect of external forces on an object's total mechanical energy by rolling a ball along the floor from point A to point B. \\

Find a nice smooth surface (e.g. a highly polished floor), mark off two positions, A and B, and roll the ball between them. 

The total mechanical energy of the ball, at each point, is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and gravitational potential energy (PE): \\

\begin{minipage}{.49\textwidth}
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{\rm{total,A}}  & = & \rm{KE}_{A} + \rm{PE}_{A}  \\
& = & \frac{1}{2}mv_{A}^{2} + mgh_{A} \\
& = & \frac{1}{2}mv_{A}^{2} + mg(0) \\
& = & \frac{1}{2}mv_{A}^{2} 
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{.49\textwidth}
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{\rm{total,B}}  & = & \rm{KE}_{B} + \rm{PE}_{B}  \\
& = & \frac{1}{2}mv_{B}^{2} + mgh_{B} \\
& = & \frac{1}{2}mv_{B}^{2} + mg(0) \\
& = & \frac{1}{2}mv_{B}^{2} 
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{minipage}

In the absence of friction and other external forces, the ball should slide along the floor and its speed should be \textit{the same} at positions A and B. Since there are no external forces acting on the ball, its total mechanical energy at points A and B are equal.\\

\begin{eqnarray*}
v_{A} & = & v_{B}\\
\frac{1}{2}mv_{A}^{2} & = & \frac{1}{2}mv_{B}^{2}\\
E_{\rm{total,A}}  & = & E_{\rm{total,B}} 
\end{eqnarray*}

Now, let's investigate what happens when there is friction (an \textit{external force}) acting on the ball.\\
Roll the ball along a rough surface or a carpeted floor. What happens to the speed of the ball at point A compared to point B? \\
If the surface you are rolling the ball along is very rough and provides a large external frictional force, then the ball should be moving much slower at point B than at point A. \\
Let's now compare the total mechanical energy of the ball at points A and B: \\

\begin{minipage}{.49\textwidth}
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{\rm{total,A}}  & = & \rm{KE}_{A} + \rm{PE}_{A}  \\
& = & \frac{1}{2}mv_{A}^{2} + mgh_{A} \\
& = & \frac{1}{2}mv_{A}^{2} + mg(0) \\
& = & \frac{1}{2}mv_{A}^{2} 
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{.49\textwidth}
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{\rm{total,B}}  & = & \rm{KE}_{B} + \rm{PE}_{B}  \\
& = & \frac{1}{2}mv_{B}^{2} + mgh_{B} \\
& = & \frac{1}{2}mv_{B}^{2} + mg(0) \\
& = & \frac{1}{2}mv_{B}^{2} 
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{minipage}

However, in this case, $v_{A} \neq v_{B}$ and therefore $E_{\rm{total,A}}  \neq E_{\rm{total,B}} $. Since 
\begin{eqnarray*}
v_{A} & > & v_{B} \\
E_{\rm{total,A}}  & > &  E_{\rm{total,B}}
\end{eqnarray*}

Therefore, the ball has lost mechanical energy as it moves across the carpet. 
However, although the ball has lost mechanical energy, energy in the larger system has still been conserved. In this case, the missing
energy is the work done by the carpet through applying a frictional force on the ball. In this case the carpet is doing negative work on the ball.

When an internal force does work on an object by an (for example, gravitational and spring forces), the total mechanical energy (KE + PE) of that object remains constant but the object's energy can change form. For example, as an object falls in a gravitational field from a high elevation to a lower elevation, some of the object's potential energy is changed into kinetic energy. However, the sum of the kinetic and potential energies remain constant. When the only forces doing work are internal forces, energy changes forms - from kinetic to potential (or vice versa); yet the total amount of mechanical energy is conserved.

\subsection{Capacity to do Work}
Energy is the capacity to do work. When positive work is done on an object, the system doing the work loses energy. In fact, {\bf the energy lost by a system is exactly equal to the work done by the system.} An object with larger potential energy has a greater capacity to do work.

\begin{wex}{Work Done on a System}{Show that a hammer of mass 2~kg does more work when dropped from a height of 10~m than when dropped from a height of 5~m. Confirm that the hammer has a greater potential energy at 10~m than at 5~m.}
{\westep{Determine what is given and what is required}
We are given:
\begin{itemize}
\item{the mass of the hammer, $m=$2~kg}
\item{height 1, $h_1$=10~m}
\item{height 2, $h_2$=5~m}
\end{itemize}
We are required to show that the hammer does more work when dropped from $h_1$ than from $h_2$. We are also required to confirm that the hammer has a greater potential energy at 10~m than at 5~m.

\westep{Determine how to approach the problem}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Calculate the work done by the hammer, $W_1$, when dropped from $h_1$ using:
\nequ{W_1=F_g\cdot h_1.}}
\item{Calculate the work done by the hammer, $W_2$, when dropped from $h_2$ using:
\nequ{W_2=F_g\cdot h_2.}}
\item{Compare $W_1$ and $W_2$}
\item{Calculate potential energy at $h_1$ and $h_2$ and compare using:
\equ{\poten=m\cdot g \cdot h.}{eq:pe}}
\end{enumerate}

\westep{Calculate $W_1$}
\begin{eqnarray*}
W_1&=&F_g\cdot h_1\\
&=&m\cdot g \cdot h_1\\
&=&(2\ekg)(9.8\emss)(10\emm)\\
&=&196\eJ
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Calculate $W_2$}
\begin{eqnarray*}
W_2&=&F_g\cdot h_2\\
&=&m\cdot g \cdot h_2\\
&=&(2\ekg)(9.8\emss)(5\emm)\\
&=&98\eJ
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Compare $W_1$ and $W_2$}
We have $W_1$=196~J and $W_2$=98~J. $W_1>W_2$ as required.

\westep{Calculate potential energy}
From \ref{eq:pe}, we see that:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\poten&=&m\cdot g \cdot h\\
&=&F_g \cdot h\\
&=&W
\end{eqnarray*}
This means that the potential energy is equal to the work done. Therefore, $\poten_1>\poten_2$, because $W_1>W_2$.
}
\end{wex}

This leads us to the work-energy theorem.

\Definition{Work-Energy Theorem}{The work-energy theorem states that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy:
\nequ{W=\Delta \kener=\kener_{f}-\kener_{i}}}

The work-energy theorem is another example of the conservation of energy which you saw in Grade 10. 

\begin{wex}{Work-Energy Theorem}{A brick of mass 1~kg is dropped from a height of 10~m. Calculate the work done on the brick at the point it hits the ground assuming that there is no air resistance?}
{\westep{Determine what is given and what is required}
We are given:
\begin{itemize}
\item{mass of the brick: $m$=1~kg}
\item{initial height of the brick: $h_i$=10~m}
\item{final height of the brick: $h_f$=0~m}
\end{itemize}
We are required to determine the work done on the brick as it hits the ground.
\westep{Determine how to approach the problem}
The brick is falling freely, so energy is conserved. We know that the work done is equal to the difference in kinetic energy. The brick has no kinetic energy at the moment it is dropped, because it is stationary. When the brick hits the ground, all the brick's potential energy is converted to kinetic energy.

\westep{Determine the brick's potential energy at $h_i$}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\poten&=&m\cdot g \cdot h\\
&=&(1\ekg)(9,8\emss)(10\emm)\\
&=&98\eJ
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Determine the work done on the brick}
The brick had 98~J of potential energy when it was released and 0~J of kinetic energy. When the brick hit the ground, it had 0~J of potential energy and 98~J of kinetic energy. Therefore $\kener_i$=0~J and $\kener_f$=98~J.

From the work-energy theorem:
\begin{eqnarray*}
W&=&\Delta \kener\\
&=&\kener_f - \kener_i\\
&=&98\eJ-0\eJ\\
&=&98\eJ
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Write the final answer}
98~J of work was done on the brick.

\begin{wex}{Work-Energy Theorem 2}{The driver of a 1 000~kg car traveling at a speed of 16,7~\ms\ applies the car's brakes when he sees a red robot. The car's brakes provide a frictional force of 8000~N. Determine the stopping distance of the car.}
{
\westep{Determine what is given and what is required}
We are given:
\begin{itemize}
\item{mass of the car: $m$=1\;000~kg}
\item{speed of the car: $v$=16,7~\ms}
\item{frictional force of brakes: $F$=8\;000~N}
\end{itemize}
We are required to determine the stopping distance of the car.

\westep{Determine how to approach the problem}
We apply the work-energy theorem. We know that all the car's kinetic energy is lost to friction. Therefore, the change in the car's kinetic energy is equal to the work done by the frictional force of the car's brakes.

Therefore, we first need to determine the car's kinetic energy at the moment of braking using:
\nequ{\kener=\frac{1}{2}mv^2}
This energy is equal to the work done by the brakes. We have the force applied by the brakes, and we can use:
\nequ{W=F\cdot d}
to determine the stopping distance.

\westep{Determine the kinetic energy of the car}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\kener&=&\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\
&=&\frac{1}{2}(1\;000\ekg)(16,7\ems)^2\\
&=&139\;445\eJ
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Determine the work done}
Assume the stopping distance is $d_0$. Then the work done is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
W=F\cdot d\\
&=&(-8\;000\eN)(d_0)
\end{eqnarray*}
The force has a negative sign because it acts in a direction opposite to the direction of motion.

\westep{Apply the work-enemy theorem}
The change in kinetic energy is equal to the work done.

\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta \kener &=&W\\
\kener_f - \kener_i&=&(-8\;000\eN)(d_0)\\
0\eJ - 139\;445\eJ&=&(-8\;000\eN)(d_0)\\
\therefore d_0&=&\frac{139\;445\eJ}{8\;000\eN}\\
&=&17,4\emm
\end{eqnarray*}
\westep{Write the final answer}
The car stops in 17,4~m.}
\end{wex}

\Tip{A force only does work on an object for the time that it is in contact with the object. For example, a person pushing a trolley does work on the trolley, but the road does no work on the tyres of a car if they turn without slipping (the force is not applied over any distance because a different piece of tyre touches the road every instant.}

\MarginTip{Energy is conserved!}

\Tip{Energy Conservation: \\
{\textbf{In the absence of friction}, the work done on an object by a system is equal to the energy gained by the object.
\nequ{\mbox{Work Done} = \mbox{Energy Transferred}}
\textbf{In the presence of friction}, only some of the energy lost by the system is transferred to useful energy. The rest is lost to friction.
\nequ{\mbox{Total Work Done} = \mbox{Useful Work Done + Work Done Against Friction}}} }

In the example of a falling mass the potential energy is known as {\em gravitational potential energy} as it is the gravitational force exerted by the earth which causes the mass to accelerate towards the ground. The gravitational field of the earth is what does the work in this case.

Another example is a rubber-band. In order to stretch a rubber-band we have
to do work on it. This means we transfer energy to the rubber-band and
it gains potential energy. This potential energy is called {\em
elastic potential energy}. Once released, the rubber-band begins to
move and elastic potential energy is transferred into kinetic energy.

\Extension{Other forms of Potential Energy}{
\begin{enumerate}
\item{elastic potential energy - potential energy is stored in a compressed or extended spring or rubber band. This potential energy is calculated by:
\nequ{\frac{1}{2}kx^2}
where $k$ is a constant that is a measure of the stiffness of the spring or rubber band and $x$ is the extension of the spring or rubber band.}
\item{Chemical potential energy is related to the making and breaking of chemical bonds. For example, a battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy.}
\item{The electrical potential energy of an electrically charged object is defined as the work that must be done to move it from an infinite distance away to its present location, in the absence of any non-electrical forces on the object. This energy is non-zero if there is another electrically charged object nearby otherwise it is given by:
\nequ{k\frac{q_1q_2}{d}}
where $k$ is Coulomb's constant. For example, an electric motor lifting an elevator converts electrical energy into gravitational potential energy.}
\item{Nuclear energy is the energy released when the nucleus of an atom is split or fused. A nuclear reactor converts nuclear energy into heat.}
\end{enumerate}
Some of these forms of energy will be studied in later chapters.}
      

\Activity{Investigation}{Energy Resources}{Energy can be taken from almost anywhere. Power plants use many different types of energy sources, including oil, coal, nuclear, biomass (organic gases), wind, solar, geothermal (the heat from the earth's rocks is very hot underground and is used to turn water to steam), tidal and hydroelectric (waterfalls). Most power stations work by using steam to turn turbines which then drive generators and create an electric current. 

Most of these sources are dependant upon the sun's energy, because
without it we would not have weather for wind and tides. The sun
is also responsible for growing plants which decompose into fossil
fuels like oil and coal. All these sources can be put under 2
headings, renewable and non-renewable. Renewable sources are
sources which will not run out, like solar energy and wind power.
Non-renewable sources are ones which will run out eventually, like
oil and coal.

It is important that we learn to appreciate conservation in
situations like this. The planet has a number of linked systems
and if we don't appreciate the long-term consequences of our
actions we run the risk of doing damage now that we will only
suffer from in many years time.

Investigate two types of renewable and two types of non-renewable energy resources, listing advantages and disadvantages of each type. Write up the results as a short report.}

\section{Power}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item power (rate at which work is done).
%The learner should be able to:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Define power as the rate at which work is done or energy is expended
%\item Calculate the power involved when work is done
%\item If a force causes an object to move at a constant velocity, calculate the power using P=Fv.
%\item Apply to real life examples, e.g. the minimum power required of an electric motor to pump water from a borehole of a particular depth at a particular rate, the power of different kinds of cars operating under different conditions
%\end{itemize}
%\end{syllabus}

Now that we understand the relationship between work and energy, we are ready to look at a quantity that defines how long it takes for a certain amount of work to be done. For example, a mother pushing a trolley full of groceries can take 30~s or 60~s to push the trolley down an aisle. She does the same amount of work, but takes a different length of time. We use the idea of \textit{power} to describe the rate at which work is done.

\Definition{Power}{Power is defined as the rate at which work is done or the rate at which energy is expended. The mathematical definition for power is:
\equ{P=F \cdot v}{eq:power}}

(\ref{eq:power}) is easily derived from the definition of work. We know that:
\begin{equation*}
W=F\cdot d.
\end{equation*}
However, power is defined as the rate at which work is done. Therefore,
\begin{equation*}
P=\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}.
\end{equation*}
This can be written as:
\begin{eqnarray*}
P&=&\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}\\
&=&\frac{\Delta(F\cdot d)}{\Delta t}\\
&=&F\frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t}\\
&=&F\cdot v
\end{eqnarray*}

The unit of power is watt (symbol W).

\Activity{Investigation}{Watt}{Show that the W is equivalent to $\mathrm{J\cdot s^{-1}}$.}

\begin{IFact}
{The unit watt is named after Scottish inventor and engineer James Watt (19 January 1736 - 19 August 1819) whose improvements to the steam engine were fundamental to the Industrial Revolution. A key feature of it was that it brought the engine out of the remote coal fields into factories.}
\end{IFact}

\Activity{Research Project}{James Watt}{Write a short report 5 pages on the life of James Watt describing his many other inventions.}

\begin{IFact}
{Historically, the \textit{horsepower} (symbol hp) was the unit used to describe the power delivered by a machine. One horsepower is equivalent to approximately 750~W. The horsepower is sometimes used in the motor industry to describe the power output of an engine. Incidentally, the horsepower was derived by James Watt to give an indication of the power of his steam engine in terms of the power of a horse, which was what most people used to for example, turn a mill wheel.}

We are required to calculate the power required.

\westep{Determine how to approach the problem}
From the force diagram, we see that the weight of the box is acting at right angles to the direction of motion. The weight does not contribute to the work done and does not contribute to the power calculation.

We can therefore calculate power from:
\nequ{P=F\cdot v}

\westep{Calculate the power required}
\begin{eqnarray*}
P&=&F\cdot v\\
&=&(10\eN)(1\ems)\\

\westep{Write the final answer}
10~W of power are required for a force of 10~N to move a 10~kg box at a speed of 1~ms over a frictionless surface.}
\end{wex}

Machines are designed and built to do work on objects. All machines usually have a power rating. The power rating indicates the rate at which that machine can do work upon other objects. 

A car engine is an example of a machine which is given a power rating. The power rating relates to how rapidly the car can accelerate. Suppose that a 50~kW engine could accelerate the car from 0~$\mathrm{km\cdot hr^{-1}}$ to 60$\mathrm{km\cdot hr^{-1}}$ in 16~s. Then a car with four times the power rating (i.e. 200~kW) could do the same amount of work in a quarter of the time. That is, a 200~kW engine could accelerate the same car from 0~$\mathrm{km\cdot hr^{-1}}$ to 60$\mathrm{km\cdot hr^{-1}}$ in 4~s.

\begin{wex}{Power Calculation 2}{A forklift lifts a crate of mass 100~kg at a constant velocity to a height of 8~m over a time of 4~s. The forklift then holds the crate in place for 20~s.

{
\westep{Determine what is given and what is required}
We are given:
\begin{itemize}
\item{mass of crate: $m$=100~kg}
\item{height that crate is raised: $h$=8~m}
\item{time taken to raise crate: $t_r$=4~s}
\item{time that crate is held in place: $t_s$=20~s}
\end{itemize}
We are required to calculate the power exerted.

\westep{Determine how to approach the problem}
We can use:
\nequ{P=F\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}}
to calculate power. The force required to raise the crate is equal to the weight of the crate.

\westep{Calculate the power required to raise the crate}
\begin{eqnarray*}
P&=&F\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\\
&=&m\cdot g\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\\
&=&(100\ekg)(9,8\emss)\frac{8\emm}{4\es}\\
&=&1\;960\eW
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Calculate the power required to hold the crate in place}
While the crate is being held in place, there is no displacement. This means there is no work done on the crate and therefore there is no power exerted.
\westep{Write the final answer}
1\;960~W of power is exerted to raise the crate and no power is exerted to hold the crate in place.

\chapter{Doppler Effect - Grade 12}
\label{p:wsl:de12}


\section{Introduction}
Have you noticed how the pitch of a police car siren changes as the car passes by or how the pitch of a radio box on the pavement changes as you drive by? This effect is known as the \textbf{Doppler Effect} and will be studied in this chapter.
\begin{IFact}
{The Doppler Effect is named after Johann Christian Andreas Doppler (29 November 1803 - 17 March 1853), an Austrian mathematician and physicist who first explained the phenomenon in 1842.}
\end{IFact}

\section{The Doppler Effect with Sound and Ultrasound}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item Only describe situation where source moves relative to observer
%\item The learner must be able to state what the Doppler Effect is for sound and give everyday examples.
%\item The learner must be able to explain why a sound increases in pitch when the source of the sound travels towards a listener and decreases in pitch when it travels away.
%\item The learner must be able to use the equation to calculate the frequency of sound detected by a listener (L) when either the listener or the source (S) is moving.
%\item The learner must be able to describe applications of the Doppler Effect with ultrasound waves in medicine, e.g. to measure the rate of blood flow or the heartbeat of a foetus in the womb.
%\item Link to Grade 11, pitch of sounds. Link to reference frames (relative motion) in Grade 12 mechanics.
%\end{syllabus}

As seen in the introduction, there are two situations which lead to the Doppler  Effect:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{When the source moves relative to the observer, for example the pitch of a car hooter as it passes by.}
\item{When the observer moves relative to the source, for example the pitch of a radio on the pavement as you drive by.}
\end{enumerate}


\Definition{Doppler Effect}{The Doppler effect is the apparent change in frequency and wavelength of a wave when the observer and the source of the wave move relative to each other.}

We experience the Doppler effect quite often in our lives, without realising that it is science taking place. The changing sound of a taxi hooter or ambulance as it drives past are examples of this as you have seen in the introduction.\\
The question is how does the Doppler effect take place. Let us consider a source of sound waves with a constant frequency and amplitude. The sound waves can be drawn as concentric circles where each circle represents another wavefront, like in figure \ref{p:wsl:de12:sss} below.
%fig 1 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-1.5,-1.5)(1.5,1.5)
%\psgrid[gridcolor=gray]
\multido{\n=0.25+0.25}{5}{\pscircle(0,0){\n}}
\pscircle*[linewidth=0.5pt](0cm,0cm){.08}
\end{pspicture}
\caption{Stationary sound source}
\label{p:wsl:de12:sss}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The sound source is the dot in the middle and is stationary. For the Doppler effect to take place, the source must be moving \textit{relative} to the observer. Let's consider the following situation: The source (dot) emits one peak (represented by a circle) that moves away from the source at the same rate in all directions. The distance between the peaks represents the wavelength of the sound. The closer together the peaks, the higher the frequency (or pitch) of the sound.

%fig 2 
\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-3,-3)(3,3)
%\psgrid
\psaxes[dx=1]{<->}(0,0)(-3,-3)(3,3)
\pscircle*[linewidth=0.5pt](0cm,0cm){.08}
\psline[linewidth=1.25pt]{->}(0,0)(0.5,0)
\pscircle[linewidth=.5pt,linecolor=gray](0cm,0cm){.75}%
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

As this peak moves away, the source also moves and then emits the second peak. Now the two circles are not concentric any more, but on the one side they are closer together and on the other side they are further apart. This is shown in the next diagram.
%fig 3
\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-3,-3)(3,3)
%\psgrid
\psaxes[dx=1]{<->}(0,0)(-3,-3)(3,3)
\pscircle*[linewidth=0.5pt](.6cm,0cm){.08}
\psline[linewidth=1.25pt]{->}(.6,0)(1.1,0)
\pscircle[linewidth=.5pt,linecolor=gray](0cm,0cm){1.5}%
\pscircle[linewidth=.5pt,linecolor=gray](.6cm,0cm){.75}%
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

If the source continues moving at the same speed in the same
direction (i.e. with the same velocity which you will learn more
about later), then the distance between peaks on the right of the
source is constant. The distance between peaks on the left is
also constant but they are different on the left and right.

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-3,-3)(3,3)
%\psgrid
\psaxes[dx=1]{<->}(0,0)(-3,-3)(3,3)
\pscircle*[linewidth=0.5pt](1.2cm,0cm){.08}
\psline[linewidth=1.25pt]{->}(1.2,0)(1.7,0)
\pscircle[linewidth=.5pt,linecolor=gray](1.2cm,0cm){.75}%
\pscircle[linewidth=.5pt,linecolor=gray](.6cm,0cm){1.5}%
\pscircle[linewidth=.5pt,linecolor=gray](0cm,0cm){2.25}%

\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

This means that the time between peaks on the right is less so the
frequency is higher. It is higher than on the left and higher than
if the source were not moving at all.

On the left hand side the peaks are further apart than on the right
and further apart than if the source were at rest - this means the
frequency is lower.\\

When a car appoaches you, the sound waves that reach you have a shorter wavelength and a higher frequency. You hear a higher sound. When the car moves away from you, the sound waves that reach you have a longer wavelength and lower frequency. You hear a lower sound.\\

This change in frequency can be calculated by using:
\equ{f_L=\frac{v + v_L}{v + v_S}f_S}{eq:de}
where $f_L$ is the frequency perceived by the listener, \\
$f_S$ is the frequency of the source, \\
$v$ is the velocity of the waves, \\
$v_L$ the velocity of the listener and \\
$v_S$ the velocity of the source.

Note: Velocity is a vector and has magnitude and direction. It is very important to get the signs of the velocities correct here:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|ll|}
\hline
Source moves towards listener & $v_S$ : negative\\
Source moves away from listener & $v_S$ : positive\\
    &   \\
Listener moves towards source & $v_L$ : positive\\
Listener moves away from source & $v_L$ : negative\\

\begin{IFact}
{
Radar-based speed-traps use the Doppler Effect. The radar gun emits radio waves of a specific frequency. When the car is standing still, the waves reflected waves are the same frequency as the waves emitted by the radar gun. When the car is moving the Doppler frequency shift can be used to determine the speed of the car.}
\end{IFact}

\subsection{Ultrasound and the Doppler Effect}
Ultrasonic waves (ultrasound) are sound waves with a frequency greater than 20~000~Hz (the upper limit of human hearing). These waves can be used in medicine to determine the direction of blood flow. The device, called a Doppler flow meter, sends out sound waves. The sound waves can travle through skin and tissue and will be reflected by moving objects in the body (like blood). The reflected waves return to the flow meter where its frequency (received frequency) is compared to the transmitted frequency.\
Because of the Doppler effect, blood that is moving towards the flow meter will change the sound to a higher frequency and blood that is moving away from the flow meter will cause a lower frequency.

Ultrasound can be used to determine whether blood is flowing in the right direction in the circulation system of unborn babies, or identify areas in the body where blood flow is restricted due to narrow veins. The use of ultrasound equipment in medicine is called sonography or ultrasonography.

\section{The Doppler Effect with Light}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to state that light emitted from many stars is shifted toward the red, or longer wavelength/lower frequency, end of the spectrum.
%\item The learner must be able to apply the Doppler effect to these "redshifts" to conclude that most stars are moving away from Earth and therefore the universe is expanding
%\item Notes: Link to Grade 12 Electricity and Magnetism, Electromagnetic Spectrum. The red end of the spectrum corresponds to lower frequency and the blue end to higher frequency light. Link to Grade 12 Matter and Materials, emission spectra and discuss the fact that stars emit light of frequencies that are determined by their composition.
%\end{syllabus}

Light is a wave and earlier you learnt how you can study the properties of one wave and apply the same ideas to another wave. The same applies to sound and light. We know the Doppler effect affects sound waves when the source is moving. Therefore, if we apply the Doppler effect to light, the frequency of the emitted light should change when the source of the light is moving relative to the observer.

When the frequency of a sound wave changes, the sound you hear changes. When the frequency of light changes, the colour you would see changes. \\
This means that the Doppler effect can be observed by a change in sound (for sound waves) and a change in colour (for light waves). Keep in mind that there are sounds that we cannot hear (for example ultrasound) and light that we cannot see (for example ultraviolet light).

We can apply all the ideas that we learnt about the Doppler effect to light. When talking about light we use slightly different names to describe what happens. If you look at the colour spectrum (more details Chapter~\ref{p:em:emr12}) then you will see that blue light has shorter wavelengths than red light. If you are in the middle of the visible colours then longer wavelengths are more red and shorter wavelengths are more blue. So we call shifts towards longer wavelengths "red-shifts" and shifts towards shorter wavelengths "blue-shifts".

A shift in wavelength is the same as a shift in frequency. Longer wavelengths of light have lower frequencies and shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies. From the Doppler effect we know that when things move towards you any waves they emit that you measure are shifted to shorter wavelengths (blueshifted). If things move away from you, the shift is to longer wavelengths (redshifted).

\subsection{The Expanding Universe}
Stars emit light, which is why we can see them at night. Galaxies are huge collections of stars. An example is our own Galaxy, the Milky Way, of which our sun is only one of the millions of stars! Using large telescopes like the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) in the Karoo, astronomers can measure the light from distant galaxies. The spectrum of light can tell us what elements are in the stars in the galaxies because each element emits/absorbs light at particular wavelengths (called spectral lines). If these lines are observed to be shifted from their usual wavelengths to shorter wavelengths, then the light from the galaxy is said to be \textit{blueshifted}. If the spectral lines are shifted to longer wavelengths, then the light from the galaxy is said to be \textit{redshifted}. 
If we think of the blueshift and redshift in Doppler effect terms, then a blueshifted galaxy would appear to be moving \textit{towards} us (the observers) and a redshifted galaxy would appear to be moving \textit{away} from us.


\Tip{
\begin{itemize}
\item{If the light source is moving away from the observer (positive velocity) then the observed frequency is lower and the observed wavelength is greater (redshifted).}
\item{If the source is moving towards (negative velocity) the observer, the observed frequency is higher and the wavelength is shorter (blueshifted).}
\end{itemize}}

Edwin Hubble (20 November 1889 - 28 September 1953) measured the Doppler shift of a large sample of galaxies. He found that the light from distant galaxies is \textit{redshifted} and he discovered that there is a proportionality relationship between the \textit{redshift} and the \textit{distance} to the galaxy. Galaxies that are further away always appear more redshifted than nearby galaxies. Remember that a redshift in Doppler terms means a velocity of the light source \textit{away} from the observer. So why do all distant galaxies appear to be moving away from our Galaxy?

The reason is that the universe is expanding! The galaxies are not actually moving themselves, rather the \textit{space} between them is expanding!

\section{Summary}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
{The Doppler Effect is the apparent change in frequency and wavelength of a wave when the observer and source of the wave move relative to each other.}
\item {The following equation can be used to calculate the frequency of the wave according to the observer or listener:
$$f_L=\frac{v + v_L}{v + v_S}f_S$$
}
\item  {
If the direction of the wave from the listener to the source is chosen as positive, the velocities have the following signs:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|ll|}
\hline
Source moves towards listener & $v_S$ : negative\\
Source moves away from listener & $v_S$ : positive\\
    &   \\
Listener moves towards source & $v_L$ : positive\\
Listener moves away from source & $v_L$ : negative\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
}
\item{The Doppler Effect can be observed in all types of waves, including ultrasound, light and radiowaves.}
\item{Sonography makes use of ultrasound and the Doppler Effect to determine the direction of blood flow.}
\item{Light is emitted by stars. Due to the Doppler Effect, the frequency of this light decreases and the starts appear red. This is called a red shift and means that the stars are moving away from the Earth. This means that the Universe is expanding.}

\chapter{Colour - Grade 12} 
\label{p:wsl:c12} 


\section{Introduction} 
The light that human beings can see is called \textit{visible light}. Visible light is actually just a small part of the large spectrum of electromagnetic radiation which you will learn more about in Chapter~\ref{p:em:emr12}. We can think of electromagnetic radiation and visible light as transverse waves. We know that transverse waves can be described by their amplitude, frequency (or wavelength) and velocity. The velocity of a wave is given by the product of its frequency and wavelength:
\begin{equation}
v = f \times \lambda
\end{equation}\label{eq:wavespeed} 

However, electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, is special because, no matter what the frequency, it all moves at a \textbf{constant velocity} (in vacuum) which is known as the speed of light. The speed of light has the symbol $c$ and is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
c &=& 3 \times 10^{8}~~\rm{m.s^{-1}}
\end{eqnarray*} 

Since the \textit{speed of light} is $c$, we can then say:
\begin{equation}
c = f \times \lambda
\end{equation}




\section{Colour and Light} 
%\begin{syllabus} 
%\item The learner must know that each colour is associated with light of a particular frequency 
%\item The learner must be able to use the equation $c=f\lambda$ to calculate the wavelength of light of a given frequency and vice versa. 
%\item The learner must be able to explain why when white light is refracted through a prism it separates into light of different colours by referring to the difference in the speed of light of different frequencies in glass 
%\item Notes: Link to Grade 10 and 11, wavelength and frequency, refraction. Link to Grade 12 Electricity and Magnetism, Electromagnetic Spectrum 
%\end{syllabus} 

Our eyes are sensitive to visible light over a range of wavelengths from 390~nm to 780~nm (1 nm = $1 \times 10^{-9}$ m). The different \textbf{colours} of light we see are related to specific \textit{frequencies} (and \textit{wavelengths}) of visible light. The wavelengths and frequencies are listed in table~\ref{t:colour:Colours}. 

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | c | c |}
\hline
\textbf{Colour} & \textbf{Wavelength range (nm)} & \textbf{Frequency range (Hz)} \\ \hline \hline
violet & 390 - 455 & 769 - 659 $\times 10^{12}$\\ \hline
blue & 455 - 492 & 659 - 610 $\times 10^{12}$\\ \hline
green & 492 - 577  & 610 - 520 $\times 10^{12}$\\ \hline
yellow & 577 - 597 & 520 - 503 $\times 10^{12}$\\ \hline
orange & 597 - 622 & 503 - 482 $\times 10^{12}$\\ \hline
red & 622 - 780  & 482 - 385 $\times 10^{12}$\\ \hline
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Colours, wavelengths and frequencies of light in the visible spectrum.}
\label{t:colour:Colours}
\end{table}

You can see from table~\ref{t:colour:Colours} that \textbf{violet} light has the \textit{shortest wavelengths} and \textit{highest frequencies} while \textbf{red} light has the \textit{longest wavelengths} and \textit{lowest frequencies}.


\begin{wex}{Calculating the frequency of light given the wavelength}
{A streetlight emits light with a wavelength of 520 nm.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What colour is the light? (Use table~\ref{t:colour:Colours} to determine the colour)
\item What is the frequency of the light? 
\end{enumerate}
}
{
\westep{What is being asked and what information are we given?}
We need to determine the colour and frequency of light with a wavelength of $\lambda = 520$ nm = $520 \times 10^{-9}$ m.

\westep{Compare the wavelength of the light to those given in table~\ref{t:colour:Colours} }
We see from table~\ref{t:colour:Colours} that light with wavelengths between 492 - 577 nm is green. 520 nm falls into this range, therefore the colour of the light is green.

\westep{Next we need to calculate the frequency of the light}
We know that 
\begin{eqnarray*}
c &=& f \times \lambda 
\end{eqnarray*}
We know $c$ and we are given that $\lambda = 520 \times 10^{-9}$ m. So we can substitute in these values and solve for the frequency $f$.
(\textbf{NOTE:} Don't forget to always change units into S.I. units! 1 nm = $1 \times 10^{-9}$ m.)

\begin{eqnarray*}
f &=& \frac{c}{\lambda} \\
 & = & \frac{3 \times 10^{8}}{520 \times 10^{-9}} \\
 & = & 577 \times 10^{12}~~\rm{Hz}
\end{eqnarray*}

The frequency of the green light is $577 \times 10^{12}$ Hz
}
\end{wex}


\begin{wex}{Calculating the wavelength of light given the frequency}
{A streetlight also emits light with a frequency of 490$ \times 10^{12}$ Hz.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What colour is the light? (Use table~\ref{t:colour:Colours} to determine the colour)
\item What is the wavelength of the light? 
\end{enumerate}
}
{
\westep{What is being asked and what information are we given?}
We need to find the colour and wavelength of light which has a frequency of 490$ \times 10^{12}$ Hz and which is emitted by the streetlight.

\westep{Compare the wavelength of the light to those given in table~\ref{t:colour:Colours}}
We can see from table~\ref{t:colour:Colours} that orange light has frequencies between 503 - 482$\times 10^{12}$ Hz. The light from the streetlight has $f = 490\times 10^{12}$ Hz which fits into this range. Therefore the light must be orange in colour.

\westep{Next we need to calculate the wavelength of the light}
We know that 
\begin{eqnarray*}
c &=& f \times \lambda 
\end{eqnarray*}
We know $c = 3 \times 10^{8}~~\rm{m.s^{-1}}$ and we are given that $f = 490 \times 10^{12}$ Hz. So we can substitute in these values and solve for the wavelength $\lambda$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lambda &=& \frac{c}{f} \\
&=& \frac{3 \times 10^{8}}{490\times 10^{12}} \\
&=& 6.122 \times 10{-7}~~\rm{m} \\
&=& 612 \times 10^{-9}~~\rm{m} \\
&=& 612~~\rm{nm}
\end{eqnarray*}

Therefore the orange light has a wavelength of 612 nm.

\subsection{Dispersion of white light}

White light, like the light which comes from the sun, is made up of \textit{all} the visible wavelengths of light. In other words, white light is a \textit{combination} of all the colours of visible light. 

%In Chapter~\ref{p:wsl:go10}, 
You learnt that the speed of light is different in different substances. The speed of light in different substances depends on the frequency of the light. For example, when white light travels through glass, light of the different frequencies is slowed down by different amounts. The lower the frequency, the less the speed is reduced which means that red light (lowest frequency) is slowed down \textit{less} than violet light (highest frequency). We can see this when white light is incident on a glass prism. 

Have a look at the picture below. When the white light hits the edge of the prism, the light which travels through the glass is refracted  as it moves from the less dense medium (air) to the more dense medium (glass).

%\caption{Dispersion of light through a prism.}
%\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{red} light which is slowed down the \textit{least}, is refracted the \textit{least}. 
\item The \textbf{violet} light which is slowed down the \textit{most}, is refracted the \textit{most}. 
\end{itemize}
When the light hits the other side of the prism it is again refracted but the angle of the prism edge allows the light to remain separated into its different colours.
White light is therefore separated into its different colours by the prism and we say that the white light has been \textbf{dispersed} by the prism.


The dispersion effect is also responsible for why we see rainbows. When sunlight hits drops of water in the atmosphere, the white light is dispersed into its different colours by the water.




\section{Addition and Subtraction of Light} 

\subsection{Additive Primary Colours}
The primary colours of light are \textbf{red}, \textbf{green} and \textbf{blue}. When all the primary colours are superposed (added together), white light is produced. Red, green and blue are therefore called the \textit{additive primary colours}. All the other colours can be produced by different combinations of red, green and blue. 

\subsection{Subtractive Primary Colours}
The subtractive primary colours are obtained by subtracting one of the three additive primary colours from white light. The subtractive primary colours are \textbf{yellow}, \textbf{magenta} and \textbf{cyan}. Magenta appears as a pinkish-purplish colour and cyan looks greenish-blue. You can see how the primary colours of light add up to the different subtractive colours in the illustration below.

\Activity{Experiment}{Colours of light}
{
\Aim{To investigate the additive properties of colours and determine the complementary colours of light.}

\Apparatus{You will need two battery operated torches with flat bulb fronts, a large piece of white paper, and some pieces of cellophane paper of the following colours: red, blue, green, yellow, cyan, magenta. (You should easily be able to get these from a newsagents.)}

\noindent Make a table in your workbook like the one below: \\

\begin{tabular}{ | l | c | c | c |}
\hline
\textbf{Colour 1} & \textbf{Colour 2} & \textbf{Final colour prediction}  & \textbf{Final colour measured}\\ \hline \hline
red & blue &  & \\ \hline
red & green & & \\ \hline
green & blue &  & \\ \hline
magenta & green & & \\ \hline
yellow & blue & & \\ \hline
cyan & red & & \\ \hline
\end{tabular} \\

\noindent Before you begin your experiment, use what you know about colours of light to write down in the third column "Final colour prediction", what you think the result of adding the two colours of light will be. You will then be able to test your predictions by making the following measurements:

\Method{Proceed according to the table above. Put the correct colour of cellophane paper over each torch bulb. e.g. the first test will be to put red cellophane on one torch and blue cellophane on the other. Switch on the torch with the red cellophane over it and shine it onto the piece of white paper. \\
\noindent What colour is the light? \\
\noindent Turn off that torch and turn on the one with blue cellophane and shine it onto the white paper. \\
\noindent What colour is the light?\\ 
\noindent Now shine both torches with their cellophane coverings onto the same spot on the white paper. What is the colour of the light produced? Write this down in the fourth column of your table. \\
\noindent Repeat the experiment for the other colours of cellophane so that you can complete your table.}

\textbf{Questions:}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item How did your predictions match up to your measurements? 
\item Complementary colours of light are defined as the colours of light which, when added to one of the primary colours, produce white light. From your completed table, write down the complementary colours for red, blue and green.
\end{enumerate}
}

\subsection{Complementary Colours}
Complementary colours are two colours of light which add together to give white. 

\Activity{Investigation}{Complementary colours for red, green and blue}{
Complementary colours are two colours which add together to give white. Place a tick in the box where the colours in the first column added to the colours in the top row give white.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|}\hline
&\textbf{magenta}&\textbf{yellow}&\textbf{cyan}\\
&(=red+blue)&(=red+green)&(=blue+green)\\\hline\hline
red&&&\\\hline
green&&&\\\hline
blue&&&\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}}

You should have found that the complementary colours for red, green and blue are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item{Red and Cyan}
\item{Green and Magenta}
\item{Blue and Yellow}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Perception of Colour}
The light-sensitive lining on the back inside half of the human eye is called the retina. 
The retina contains two kinds of light sensitive cells or \textit{photoreceptors}: the rod cells (sensitive to low light) and the cone cells (sensitive to normal daylight) which enable us to see. The rods are not sensitive to colour but work well in dimly lit conditions. This is why it is possible to see in a dark room, but it is hard to see any colours. Only your rods are sensitive to the low light levels and so you can only see in black, white and grey.
The cones enable us to see colours.
Normally, there are three kinds of cones, each containing a different pigment. The cones are activated when the pigments absorb light. 
The three types of cones are sensitive to (i.e. absorb) red, blue and green light respectively. Therefore we can perceive \textit{all} the different colours in the visible spectrum when the different types of cones are stimulated by different amounts since they are just combinations of the three primary colours of light.

The rods and cones have different response times to light. The cones react quickly when bright light falls on them. The rods take a longer time to react. This is why it takes a while (about 10 minutes) for your eyes to adjust when you enter a dark room after being outside on a sunny day. 


\begin{IFact}
{Color blindness in humans is the inability to perceive differences between some or all colors that other people can see. Most often it is a genetic problem, but may also occur because of eye, nerve, or brain damage, or due to exposure to certain chemicals. The most common forms of human color blindness result from problems with either the middle or long wavelength sensitive cone systems, and involve difficulties in discriminating reds, yellows, and greens from one another. This is called "red-green color blindness". Other forms of color blindness are much rarer. They include problems in discriminating blues from yellows, and the rarest forms of all, complete color blindness or monochromasy, where one cannot distinguish any color from grey, as in a black-and-white movie or photograph.}
\end{IFact}

\begin{wex}{Seeing Colours}{When blue and green light fall on an eye, is cyan light being created? Discuss.}{Cyan light is not created when blue and green light fall on the eye. The blue and green receptors are stimulated to make the brain believe that cyan light is being created.}
\end{wex}

\subsection{Colours on a Television Screen}
If you look very closely at a colour cathode-ray television screen or cathode-ray computer screen, you will see that there are very many small red, green and blue dots called \textit{phosphors} on it. These dots are caused to fluoresce (glow brightly) when a beam of electrons from the cathode-ray tube behind the screen hits them. Since different combinations of the three primary colours of light can produce any other colour, only red, green and blue dots are needed to make pictures containing all the colours of the visible spectrum.

\end{enumerate}
}


\section{Pigments and Paints}

We have learnt that white light is a combination of all the colours of the visible spectrum and that each colour of light is related to a different frequency. But what gives everyday objects around us their different colours? 

Pigments are substances which give an object its colour by absorbing certain frequencies of light and reflecting other frequencies. For example, a red pigment absorbs all colours of light except red which it reflects. Paints and inks contain pigments which gives the paints and inks different colours. 


\subsection{Colour of opaque objects}
Objects which you \textit{cannot} see through (i.e. they are not transparent) are called \textbf{opaque}. Examples of some opaque objects are metals, wood and bricks. The colour of an opaque object is determined by the colours (therefore \textit{frequencies}) of light which it \textit{reflects}. For example, when white light strikes a blue opaque object such as a ruler, the ruler will absorb all frequencies of light \textit{except} blue, which will be reflected. The reflected blue light is the light which makes it into our eyes and therefore the object will appear blue.

Opaque objects which appear white do not absorb any light. They reflect all the frequencies.
Black opaque objects absorb all frequencies of light. They do not reflect at all and therefore appear to have no colour.

\begin{wex}
{Colour of Opaque Objects}{If we shine white light on a sheet of paper that can only reflect green light, what is the colour of the paper?}{Since the colour of an object is determined by that frequency of light that is \textit{reflected}, the sheet of paper will appear green, as this is the only frequency that is reflected. All the other frequencies are absorbed by the paper.}
\end{wex}

\begin{wex}{Colour of an opaque object II}
{The cover of a book appears to have a magenta colour. What colours of light does it reflect and what colours does it absorb?}
{We know that magenta is a combination of red and blue primary colours of light. Therefore the object must be reflecting blue and red light and absorb green. }
\end{wex}

\subsection{Colour of transparent objects}
If an object is \textbf{transparent} it means that you can see through it. For example, glass, clean water and some clear plastics are transparent. The colour of a transparent object is determined by the colours (frequencies) of light which it \textit{transmits} (allows to pass through it). For example, a cup made of green glass will appear green because it absorbs all the other frequencies of light \textit{except} green, which it transmits. This is the light which we receive in our eyes and the object appears green. 


\begin{wex}
{Colour of Transparent Objects}{If white light is shone through a glass plate that absorbs light of all frequencies except red, what is the colour of the glass plate?}
{Since the colour of an object is determined by that frequency of light that is \textit{transmitted}, the glass plate will appear red, as this is the only frequency that is not absorbed.}
\end{wex}



\subsection{Pigment primary colours}
The primary pigments and paints are \textbf{cyan}, \textbf{magenta} and \textbf{yellow}. When pigments or paints of these three colours are mixed together in equal amounts they produce \textbf{black}. Any other colour of paint can be made by mixing the primary pigments together in different quantities. The primary pigments are related to the primary colours of light in the following way:

What type of lines (straight, curved, etc) do you get? How does this compare to the line that joins the sources?}

Consider three point sources of waves. If each source emits waves isotropically (i.e. the same in all directions) we will get the situation shown in  as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:p:wsl:2d3d12:wavefront}.

We define a \textbf{wavefront} as the imaginary line that joins waves that are in phase. These are indicated by the grey, vertical lines in Figure~\ref{fig:p:wsl:2d3d12:wavefront}. The points that are in phase can be peaks, troughs or anything in between, it doesn't matter which points you choose as long as they are in phase.


\section{The Huygens Principle}
%\begin{syllabus}

%\end{syllabus}

Christiaan Huygens described how to determine the path of waves through a medium. 
 
\Definition{The Huygens Principle}{Each point on a wavefront acts like a point source of circular waves. The waves emitted from these point sources interfere to form another wavefront.}

A simple example of the Huygens Principle is to consider the single wavefront in Figure~\ref{fig:p:wsl:2d3d12:huygens}.

\begin{IFact}
{Christiaan Huygens (14 April 1629 - 8 July 1695), was a Dutch mathematician, astronomer and physicist; born in The Hague as the son of Constantijn Huygens. He studied law at the University of Leiden and the College of Orange in Breda before turning to science. Historians commonly associate Huygens with the scientific revolution.

Huygens generally receives minor credit for his role in the development of modern calculus. He also achieved note for his arguments that light consisted of waves; see: wave-particle duality in Chapter~\ref{}. In 1655, he discovered Saturn's moon Titan. He also examined Saturn's planetary rings, and in 1656 he discovered that those rings consisted of rocks. In the same year he observed and sketched the Orion Nebula. He also discovered several interstellar nebulae and some double stars.}

%\end{syllabus}

Interference occurs when two identical waves pass through the same region of space at the same time resulting in a superposition of waves. There are two types of interference which is of interest: \textbf{constructive} interference and \textbf{destructive} interference. 

Constructive interference occurs when both waves have a displacement in the same direction, while destructive interference occurs when one wave has a displacement in the opposite direction to the other, thereby resulting in a cancellation. When two waves interfere destructively, the resultant absolute displacement of the medium is less than in either of the individual displacements. When \textit{total} destructive interference occurs, there is no displacement of the medium. For constructive interference the displacement of the medium is greater than the individual displacements. 

Constructive interference is the result of two waves with similar phase overlapping. This means that positive parts of one wave tend to overlap with positive parts of the other, and alike for the negative parts. When positive is added to positive and negative is added to negative, the net absolute displacement of the medium is greater than the displacements of the individual waves.

Destructive interference, on the other hand, is the result of two waves with non-similar phase (i.e. anti-phase) overlapping. This means that the positive parts of one wave tend to align with the negative parts of the second wave. When the waves are added together, the positive and negative contributions lead to a net absolute displacement of the medium which is less than the absolute displacements of either of the individual waves. A place where destructive interference takes place is called a node.

Waves can interfere at places where there is never a trough and trough or peak and peak or trough and peak at the same time. At these places the waves will add together and the resultant displacement will be the sum of the two waves but they won't be points of maximum interference.

Consider the two identical waves shown in the picture below. The wavefronts of the peaks are shown as black lines while the wavefronts of the troughs are shown as grey lines. You can see that the black lines cross other black lines in many places. This means two peaks are in the same place at the same time so we will have constructive interference where the two peaks add together to form a bigger peak.

\end{center}

Two points sources (A and B) radiate identical waves. The wavefronts of the peaks (black lines) and troughs (grey lines) are shown. Constructive interference occurs where two black lines intersect or where two gray lines intersect. Destructive interference occurs where a black line intersects with a grey line.

When the grey lines cross other grey lines there are two troughs in the same place at the same time so we will have constructive interference where the two troughs add together to form a bigger trough.

In the case where a grey line crosses a black line we are seeing a trough and peak at the same time. These will cancel each other out and the medium will have no displacement at that point.

\begin{itemize}
\item black line + black line = peak + peak = constructive interference 
\item grey line + grey line = trough + trough = constructive interference
\item black line + grey line = grey line + black line = peak + trough = trough + peak = destructive interference
\end{itemize}

On half the picture below, we have marked the constructive interference with a solid black diamond and the destructive interference with a hollow diamond.

\section{Diffraction}

%\item The learner must be able to define diffraction as the ability of a wave to spread out in wavefronts as they pass through a small aperture or around a sharp edge.
%\item The learner must be able to apply Huygens' principle to explain diffraction qualitatively. Light and dark areas can be described in terms of constructive and destructive interference of secondary wavelets.
%\item The learner must be able to sketch the diffraction pattern for a single slit.
%\item The learner must be able to use the approximation theta = (m lambda)/a for a slit of width a to calculate the position (angle from the horizontal) of the dark bands in a single slit diffraction pattern, where m=+1, +2, +3, ...
%\item Notes: It is very helpful to use water waves in a ripple tank to demonstrate diffraction and interference. 
%\end{syllabus}


One of the most interesting, and also very useful, properties of waves is \textbf{diffraction}.

\Definition{Diffraction}{Diffraction is the ability of a wave to spread out in wavefronts as the wave passes through a small aperture or around a sharp edge.}

\Extension{Diffraction}{Diffraction refers to various phenomena associated with wave propagation, such as the bending, spreading and interference of waves emerging from an aperture. It occurs with any type of wave, including sound waves, water waves, electromagnetic waves such as light and radio waves. While diffraction always occurs, its effects are generally only noticeable for waves where the wavelength is on the order of the feature size of the diffracting objects or apertures.}

For example, if two rooms are connected by an open doorway and a sound is produced in a remote corner of one of them, a person in the other room will hear the sound as if it originated at the doorway. 
\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-3,-3)(3,3)
\psline(-2,-2)(-2,2)(2,2)(2,-2)(-2,-2)
\psline(0,2)(0,0.5)
\psline(0,-2)(0,-0.5)
\psdot(-1.8,1.8)
\psarc(-1.8,1.8){0.2}{280}{350}
\psarc(-1.8,1.8){0.4}{280}{350}
\psarc(-1.8,1.8){0.6}{280}{350}
\psarc(0.1,0){0.2}{280}{80}
\psarc(0.1,0){0.4}{280}{80}
\psarc(0.1,0){0.6}{280}{80}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

As far as the second room is concerned, the vibrating air in the doorway is the source of the sound. The same is true of light passing the edge of an obstacle, but this is not as easily observed because of the short wavelength of visible light.

This means that when waves move through small holes they appear to bend around the sides because there are not enough points on the wavefront to form another straight wavefront. This is bending round the sides we call \emph{diffraction}.


\Extension{Diffraction}{Diffraction effects are more clear for water waves with longer wavelengths. Diffraction can be demonstrated by placing small barriers and obstacles in a ripple tank and observing the path of the water waves as they encounter the obstacles. The waves are seen to pass around the barrier into the regions behind it; subsequently the water behind the barrier is disturbed. The amount of diffraction (the sharpness of the bending) increases with increasing wavelength and decreases with decreasing wavelength. In fact, when the wavelength of the waves are smaller than the obstacle, no noticeable diffraction occurs.}

\Activity{Experiment}{Diffraction}{Water waves in a ripple tank can be used to demonstrate diffraction and interference. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Turn on the wave generator so that it produces waves with a high frequency (short wavelength). 
  \begin{itemize} 
  	\item Place a few obstacles, one at a time, (e.g. a brick or a ruler) in the ripple tank. What happens to the wavefronts as they propagate near/past the obstacles? Draw your observations.
	\item How does the diffraction change when you change the size of the object?
  \end{itemize}
\item Now turn down the frequency of the wave generator so that it produces waves with longer wavelengths. 
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Place the same obstacles in the ripple tank (one at a time). What happens to the wavefronts as they propagate near/past the obstacles? Draw your observations.
	\item How does the diffraction change from the higher frequency case? 
 \end{itemize}
 \item Remove all obstacles from the ripple tank and insert a second wave generator. Turn on both generators so that they start at the same time and have the same frequency.
 	\begin{itemize}
		\item What do you notice when the two sets of wavefronts meet each other? 
		\item Can you identify regions of constructive and destructive interference?
	\end{itemize}
\item Now turn on the generators so that they are out of phase (i.e. start them so that they do not make waves at exactly the same time). 
 	\begin{itemize}
		\item What do you notice when the two sets of wavefronts meet each other? 
		\item Can you identify regions of constructive and destructive interference?
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Diffraction through a Slit}
When a wave strikes a barrier with a hole only part of the wave can move through the hole. If the hole is similar in size to the wavelength of the wave then diffraction occurs. The waves that come through the hole no longer looks like a straight wave front. It bends around the edges of the hole. If the hole is small enough it acts like a point source of circular waves.

Now if we allow the wavefront to impinge on a barrier with a hole in it, then only the points on the wavefront that move into the hole can continue emitting forward moving waves - but because a lot of the wavefront has been removed, the points on the edges of the hole emit waves that bend round the edges.

Each point of the slit acts like a point source. If we think about the two point sources on the edges of the slit and call them A and B then we can go back to the diagram we had earlier but with some parts blocked by the wall.

If this diagram were showing sound waves then the sound would be louder (constructive interference) in some places and quieter (destructive interference) in others. You can start to see that there will be a pattern (interference pattern) to the louder and quieter places. If we were studying light waves then the light would be brighter in some places than others depending on the interference.

The intensity (how bright or loud) of the interference pattern for a single narrow slit looks like this:

The picture above shows how the waves add together to form the interference pattern. The peaks correspond to places where the waves are adding most intensely and the minima are places where destructive interference is taking place. When looking at interference patterns from light the spectrum looks like:

\begin{pspicture}(-3.5,-1)(3.5,1)
\psdiffractionRectangle[a=0.5e-3,k=20,f=10,pixel=0.5,lambda=450]

%\psdiffractionRectangle[IIID,Alpha=10,a=0.5e-3,k=20,f=10,pixel=0.5,lambda=450]
%\end{pspicture}

There is a formula we can use to determine where the peaks and minima are in the interference spectrum. There will be more than one minimum. There are the same number of minima on either side of the central peak and the distances from the first one on each side are the same to the peak. The distances to the peak from the second minimum on each side is also the same, in fact the two sides are mirror images of each other. We label the first minimum that corresponds to a positive angle from the centre as $m=1$ and the first on the other side (a negative angle from the centre) as $m=-1$, the second set of minima are labelled $m=2$ and $m=-2$ etc.

The equation for the angle at which the minima occur is given in the definition below:

$\theta$ is the angle to the minimum\\

}



\begin{wex}{Diffraction Minimum I}
{A slit with a width of 2511 nm has red light of wavelength 650 nm impinge on it. The diffracted light interferes on a surface. At which angle will the first minimum be? }
{
\westep{Check what you are given}
We know that we are dealing with interference patterns from the diffraction of light passing through a slit. The slit has a width of 2511 nm which is $2511 \times 10^{-9}\ \rm{m}$ and we know that the wavelength of the light is 650 nm which is $650 \times 10^{-9}\ \rm{m}$. We are looking to determine the angle to first minimum so we know that $m=1$.
\westep{Applicable principles}
We know that there is a relationship between the slit width, wavelength and interference minimum angles:
\begin{equation*}
\sin\theta = \frac{m\lambda}{a}
\end{equation*}
We can use this relationship to find the angle to the minimum by substituting what we know and solving for the angle.
\westep{Substitution}
\begin{eqnarray*}

The first minimum is at 15 degrees from the centre peak.

\end{eqnarray*}
The first minimum is at 12.2 degrees from the centre peak.
}
\end{wex}

From the formula $\sin\theta = \frac{m\lambda}{a}$ you can see that a smaller wavelength for the same slit results in a smaller angle to the interference minimum. This is something you just saw in the two worked examples. Do a sanity check, go back and see if the answer makes sense. Ask yourself which light had the longer wavelength, which light had the larger angle and what do you expect for longer wavelengths from the formula.

\section{Shock Waves and Sonic Booms}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to describe, with the aid of a diagram, the formation of a shock wave as an example of interference of wavefronts formed when the object emitting waves is traveling faster than the speed of the waves in the medium
%\item The learner must be able to define the terms:(1) subsonic (2) supersonic (3) "Mach" number
%\item The learner must be able to explain the phenomenon of shockwaves in terms of the Doppler Effect and constructive interference of sound waves.
%\item The learner must be able to state that a "sonic boom" is the sound heard by an observer as a shockwave passes.
%\item The learner must be able to show that the half-angle of the cone of the sonic boom may be calculated from vw = vs sin theta. (Advanced)
%\end{syllabus}

Now we know that the waves move away from the source at the speed of sound. What happens if the source moves at the same time as emitting sounds? Once a sound wave has been emitted it is no longer connected to the source so if the source moves it doesn't change the way the sound wave is propagating through the medium. This means a source can actually catch up to the sound waves it has emitted. 

The speed of sound is very fast in air, about $340\ \rm{m\cdot s}^{-1}$, so if we want to talk about a source catching up to sound waves then the source has to be able to move very fast. A good source of sound waves to discuss is a jet aircraft. Fighter jets can move very fast and they are very noisy so they are a good source of sound for our discussion. Here are the speeds for a selection of aircraft that can fly faster than the speed of sound.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
Aircraft & speed at altitude ($\rm{km\cdot h}^{-1}$) & speed at altitude ($\rm{m\cdot s}^{-1}$) \\ \hline \hline
Concorde & 2 330 & 647 \\ \hline
Gripen & 2 410 & 669 \\ \hline
Mirage F1 & 2 573 &  715 \\ \hline
Mig 27 & 1 885 & 524 \\ \hline
F 15 & 2 660 & 739 \\ \hline
F 16 & 2 414 & 671 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Subsonic Flight}
\Definition{Subsonic}{Subsonic refers to speeds slower than the speed of sound.}

When a source emits sound waves and is moving slower than the speed of sound you get the situation in this picture. Notice that the source moving means that the wavefronts, and therefore peaks in the wave, are actually closer together in the one direction and further apart in the other.

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(0,-2)(4,1.4)
%\psgrid[gridcolor=gray]
\rput(0.75,0){
\pscircle*(0,0){.08}
\psline[linewidth=1.25pt]{<-}(-0.5,0)(0,0)
\pscircle(0,0){0.25}%
\pscircle(0.15,0){0.5}%

\pscircle(0.6,0){1.25}%
\uput[d](0.625,-1.5){subsonic flight}
}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

If you measure the waves on the side where the peaks are closer together you'll measure a different wavelength than on the other side of the source. This means that the noise from the source will sound different on the different sides. This is called the \emph{Doppler Effect}.%, see Chapter~\ref{p:wsl:de12s}.

\Definition{Doppler Effect}{when the wavelength and frequency measured by an observer are different to those emitted by the source due to movement of the source or observer.}

\subsection{Supersonic Flight}

\Definition{Supersonic}{Supersonic refers to speeds faster than the speed of sound.}

If a plane flies at exactly the speed of sound then the waves that it emits in the direction it is flying won't be able to get away from the plane. It also means that the next sound wave emitted will be exactly on top of the previous one, look at this picture to see what the wavefronts would look like: 

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-2,-2)(4,1.4)
\pscircle*[linewidth=0.5pt](0,0){.08}
\psline[linewidth=1.25pt]{<-}(-0.5,0)(0,0)

\psline(0,-1)(0,1)
\uput[d](1.3,-1.5){shock wave at Mach 1}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

Sometimes we use the speed of sound as a reference to describe the speed of the object (aircraft in our discussion).
\Definition{Mach Number}{The Mach Number is the ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound in the surrounding medium.}
Mach number is tells you how many times faster than sound the aircraft is moving.

\begin{itemize}
\item Mach Number $<$ 1 : aircraft moving slower than the speed of sound
\item Mach Number $=$ 1 : aircraft moving at the speed of sound
\item Mach Number $>$ 1 : aircraft moving faster than the speed of sound
\end{itemize}

To work out the Mach Number divide the speed of the aircraft by the speed of sound. 

\begin{equation*}
\rm{Mach\ Number} = \frac{v_{aircraft}}{v_{sound}}
\end{equation*}
\textbf{Remember:} the units must be the same before you divide.

If the aircraft is moving faster than the speed of sound then the wavefronts look like this:

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-2,-2)(4,1.4)
\pscircle*(-.25,0){.08}
\psline[linewidth=1.25pt]{<-}(-0.75,0)(-0.25,0)

\pscircle(0.5,0){0.5}%

\pscircle(2,0){1.25}%
\uput[d](1.8,-1.5){supersonic shock wave}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

If the source moves faster than the speed of sound, a cone of wave fronts is created. This is called a Mach cone. From constructive interference, we know that two peaks that add together form a larger peak. In a Mach cone many, many peaks add together to form a very large peak. This is a sound wave so the large peak is a very, very loud sound wave. This sounds like a huge "boom" and we call the noise a \emph{sonic boom}.  

\Definition{Sonic Boom}{A sonic boom is the sound heard by an observer as a shockwave passes.}

\begin{wex}{Mach Speed I}
{An aircraft flies at 1300 $\rm{km\cdot h}^{-1}$ and the speed of sound in air is $340\ \rm{m\cdot s}^{-1}$. What is the Mach Number of the aircraft?}
{
\westep{Check what you are given}
We know we are dealing with Mach Number. We are given the speed of sound in air, $340\ \rm{m\cdot s}^{-1}$, and the speed of the aircraft, 1300 $\rm{km\cdot h}^{-1}$. The speed of the aircraft is in different units to the speed of sound so we need to convert the units:
\begin{eqnarray*}
1300 \rm{km\cdot h}^{-1} & = & 1300 \rm{km\cdot h}^{-1} \\
1300 \rm{km\cdot h}^{-1} & = & 1300 \times \frac{1000\rm{m}}{3600\rm{s}} \\
1300 \rm{km\cdot h}^{-1} & = & 361.1\ \rm{m\cdot s}^{-1}
\end{eqnarray*}
\westep{Applicable principles}
We know that there is a relationship between the Mach Number, the speed of sound and the speed of the aircraft:
\begin{equation*}
\rm{Mach\ Number} = \frac{v_{aircraft}}{v_{sound}}
\end{equation*}
We can use this relationship to find the Mach Number.
\westep{Substitution}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\rm{Mach\ Number} &=& \frac{v_{aircraft}}{v_{sound}} \\
\rm{Mach\ Number} &=& \frac{361.1}{340} \\
\rm{Mach\ Number} &=& 1.06 \\
\end{eqnarray*}
The Mach Number is 1.06.
}
\end{wex}


\Exercise{Mach Number}{
In this exercise we will determine the Mach Number for the different aircraft in the previous table. To help you get started we have calculated the Mach Number for the Concord with a speed of sound $v_{sound}=340\ \rm{ms}^{-1}$.

For the Condorde we know the speed and we know that:
\begin{equation*}
\rm{Mach\ Number} = \frac{v_{aircraft}}{v_{sound}}
\end{equation*}
For the Concorde this means that
\begin{eqnarray*}
\rm{Mach\ Number} &=& \frac{647}{340}\\
& = & 1.9 \\
\end{eqnarray*}


\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline
Aircraft & speed at altitude ($\rm{km\cdot h}^{-1}$) & speed at altitude ($\rm{m\cdot s}^{-1}$) & Mach Number \\ \hline \hline
Concorde & 2 330 & 647 & 1.9 \\ \hline
Gripen & 2 410 & 669 & \\ \hline
Mirage F1 & 2 573 &  715 & \\ \hline
Mig 27 & 1 885 & 524 &  \\ \hline
F 15 & 2 660 & 739 &  \\ \hline
F 16 & 2 414 & 671 &  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Now calculate the Mach Numbers for the other aircraft in the table.
}

\subsection{Mach Cone}

The shape of the Mach Cone depends on the speed of the aircraft. When the Mach Number is 1 there is no cone but as the aircraft goes faster and faster the angle of the cone gets smaller and smaller.

If we go back to the supersonic picture we can work out what the angle of the cone must be.
\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(0,-2)(5,1.4)
\pscircle*(-.25,0){.08}
\psline[linewidth=1.25pt]{<-}(-0.75,0)(-0.25,0)

\pscircle(2,0){1.25}%
\uput[d](1.8,-1.5){supersonic shock wave}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

We build a triangle between how far the plane has moved and how far a wavefront at right angles to the direction the plane is flying has moved:

An aircraft emits a sound wavefront. The wavefront moves at the speed of sound 340 $\rm{m\cdot s}^{-1}$ and the aircraft moves at Mach 1.5, which is $1.5\ \times\ 340 = 510\ \rm{m\cdot s}^{-1}$. The aircraft travels faster than the wavefront. If we let the wavefront travel for a time $t$ then the following diagram will apply:

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-1,-2.5)(4,2.5)
\pscircle[linecolor=gray](3.0,0){2.0}%
\psline[linecolor=gray]{->}(3.0,0)(3.0,2.)
\pscircle*(0.,0){.08}
\psline[linewidth=1.25pt]{<-}(-.75,0)(0,0)
\psline[linestyle=dashed](0,0)(3,0)
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

We know how fast the wavefront and the aircraft are moving so we know the distances that they have traveled:

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-1,-2.5)(4,2.5)
\pscircle[linecolor=gray](3.0,0){2.0}%
\psline[linecolor=gray]{->}(3.0,0)(3.0,2.)
\rput[l](3.1,.3){$v_{sound}\times t$}
\rput(1.4,.2){$v_{aircraft}\times t$}
\rput(.6,-.2){$\theta$}
\pscircle*(0.,0){.08}
\psline[linewidth=1.25pt]{<-}(-.75,0)(0,0)
\psline(0,0)(3,0)
\psline(0,0)(1.66666,-1.490711)
\psline(1.66666,-1.490711)(3,0)
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

The angle between the cone that forms and the direction of the plane can be found from the right-angle triangle we have drawn into the figure. We know that $\sin\theta=\frac{\rm{opposite}}{\rm{hypotenuse}}$ which in this figure means:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\sin\theta&=&\frac{\rm{opposite}}{\rm{hypotenuse}} \\
\sin\theta&=&\frac{v_{sound}\times t}{v_{aircraft}\times t} \\
\sin\theta&=&\frac{v_{sound}}{v_{aircraft}} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

In this case we have used sound and aircraft but a more general way of saying this is:
\begin{itemize}
\item aircraft = source
\item sound = wavefront
\end{itemize}

We often just write the equation as:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sin\theta&=&\frac{v_{sound}}{v_{aircraft}} \\
v_{aircraft}\sin\theta&=&v_{sound} \\
v_{source}\sin\theta&=&v_{wavefront} \\
v_{s}\sin\theta&=&v_{w} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

From this equation, we can see that the faster the source (aircraft) moves, the smaller the angle of the Mach cone.


\Exercise{Mach Cone}{
In this exercise we will determine the Mach Cone Angle for the different aircraft in the table mentioned above. To help you get started we have calculated the Mach Cone Angle for the Concorde with a speed of sound $v_{sound}=340\ \rm{m\cdot s}^{-1}$.

For the Condorde we know the speed and we know that:
\begin{equation*}
\sin\theta = \frac{v_{sound}}{v_{aircraft}}
\end{equation*}
For the Concorde this means that
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sin\theta &=& \frac{340}{647}\\
\theta & = & \sin^{-1} \frac{340}{647} \\
\theta & = & 31.7^{\rm{o}} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline
Aircraft & speed at altitude ($\rm{km\cdot h}^{-1}$) & speed at altitude ($\rm{m\cdot s}^{-1}$) & Mach Cone Angle (degrees) \\ \hline \hline
Concorde & 2 330 & 647 & 31.7 \\ \hline
Gripen & 2 410 & 669 & \\ \hline
Mirage F1 & 2 573 &  715 & \\ \hline
Mig 27 & 1 885 & 524 &  \\ \hline
F 15 & 2 660 & 739 &  \\ \hline
F 16 & 2 414 & 671 &  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Now calculate the Mach Cone Angles for the other aircraft in the table.

\chapter{Wave Nature of Matter - Grade 12}
\label{p:wsl:wnm12}

\section{Introduction}
% Note to Editors: This chapter should perhaps be moved later in the book, as some information which is supposed to be known only comes after this chapter!}

In chapters \ref{p:em:emr12} and \ref{p:mm:op12} the so-called wave-particle duality of light is described. This duality states that light displays properties of both waves and of particles, depending on the experiment performed. For example, interference and diffraction of light are properties of its  wave nature, while the photoelectric effect is a property of its particle nature. In fact we call a particle of light a photon.

Hopefully you have realised that nature loves symmetry. So, if light which was originally believed to be a wave also has a particle nature, then perhaps particles, also display a wave nature. In other words matter which we originally thought of as particles may also display a wave-particle duality.

\section{de Broglie Wavelength}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to derive the formula for calculating the de Broglie wavelength ($\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$).
%\item The learner must be able to show that a wavelength calculated for something like a moving cricket ball is so small as to be meaningless but that for a fast-moving electron, the wavelength is such as to expect it to undergo diffraction in the right circumstances.
%\item The learner must be able to calculate the de Broglie wavelength for electrons of varying speeds.
%\item The learner must be able to relate the de Broglie wavelength of the electron to wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum. i.e. they are much smaller than that of visible light
%\item Learners should already be able to:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Describe structure of an atom.
%\item Apply the concept of momentum.
%\item Describe the electromagnetic spectrum.
%\item Describe the dual nature of electromagnetic radiation.
%\item Describe that light is transmitted as tiny particles known as photons.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{syllabus}

Einstein showed that for a photon, its momentum, $p$, is equal to its energy, $E$ divided by the speed of light, $c$:
$$p=\frac{E}{c}.$$
The energy of the photon can also be expressed in terms of the wavelength of the light, $\lambda$:
$$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda},$$
where $h$ is Planck's constant. Combining these two equations we find that the the momentum of the photon is related to its wavelength
$$p=\frac{hc}{c\lambda}=\frac{h}{\lambda},$$
or equivalently
$$\lambda=\frac{h}{p}.$$

In 1923, Louis de Broglie proposed that this equation not only holds for photons, but also holds for  particles of matter. This is known as the de Broglie hypothesis.
 
\Definition{De Broglie Hypothesis}{A particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$  has a wavelength $\lambda$ related to is momentum $p=mv$ by \begin{equation}
\lambda=\frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}\end{equation}
This wavelength, $\lambda$, is known as the de Broglie wavelength of the particle (where $h$ is Planck's constant).
 }

Since the value of Planck's constant is incredibly small $h = 6.63\times10^{-34}~\mathrm{J\cdot s}$, the wavelike nature of everyday objects is not really observable. 

\begin{IFact}
{The de Broglie hypothesis was proposed by French physicist Louis de Broglie (15 August 1892 -- 19 March 1987) in 1923 in his PhD thesis. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929 for this work, which made him the first person to receive a Nobel Prize on a PhD thesis.}
\end{IFact}

\begin{wex}{de Broglie Wavelength of a Cricket Ball}{A cricket ball has a mass of $0,150\ekg$ and is bowled towards a bowler at $40\ems$. Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the cricket ball?}
{\westep{Determine what is required and how to approach the problem}
We are required to calculate the de Broglie wavelength of a cricket ball given its mass and speed. We can do this by using:
$$\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}$$

\westep{Determine what is given}
We are given:
\begin{itemize}
\item The mass of the cricket ball $m=0,150\ekg$
\item The velocity of the cricket ball $v=40\ems$
\end{itemize}
and we know:
\begin{itemize}
\item Planck's constant $h=6,63\times 10^{-34}~\mathrm{J\cdot s}$
\end{itemize}

\westep{Calculate the de Broglie wavelength}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lambda&=&\frac{h}{mv}\\
&=&\frac{6,63 \times 10^{-34}\;\mathrm{J\cdot s}}{(0,150\ekg)(40~\ems)}\\
&=& 1,11 \times 10^{-34}\emm
\end{eqnarray*}
}
\end{wex}
This wavelength is considerably smaller than the diameter of a proton which is approximately $10^{-15}~\emm$. Hence the wave-like properties of this cricket ball are too small to be  observed.

$$\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}$$

\westep{Determine what is given}
We are given:
\begin{itemize}
\item The velocity of the electron {$v=40\ems$}
\end{itemize}
and we know:
\begin{itemize}
\item The mass of the electron {$m_{e}=9,11 \times 10^{-31}\ekg$}
\item Planck's constant {$h=6,63 \times 10^{-34}~\mathrm{J\cdot s}$}
\end{itemize}

\begin{eqnarray*}

& = & 1,82 \times 10^{-5}\emm\\
&=&0,0182\;\mathrm{mm}
\end{eqnarray*}
}
\end{wex}


Although the electron and cricket ball in the two previous examples are travelling at the same velocity the de Broglie wavelength of the electron is much larger than that of the cricket ball. This is because the wavelength is inversely proportional to the mass of the particle.

& = & 2,43 \times 10^{-9}\emm
\end{eqnarray*}
This is the size of an atom. For this reason, electrons moving at high velocities can be used to ``probe" the structure of atoms. This is discussed in more detail at the end of this chapter.  Figure \ref{rel-wave-leng} compares the wavelengths of fast moving electrons to the wavelengths of visible light.}
\end{wex}

Since the de Broglie wavelength of a particle is inversely proportional to its velocity, the wavelength decreases as the velocity increases. This is confirmed in the last two examples with the electrons. 
De Broglie's hypothesis was confirmed by Davisson and Germer in 1927 when they observed a beam of electrons being diffracted off a nickel surface. The diffraction means that the moving electrons have a wave nature. They were also able to determine the wavelength of the electrons from the diffraction. To measure a wavelength one needs two or more diffracting centres such as pinholes, slits or atoms. For diffraction to occur the centres must be separated by a distance about the same size as the wavelength. Theoretically, all objects, not just sub-atomic particles, exhibit wave properties according to the de Broglie hypothesis.

%\end{itemize}

%\end{syllabus}

We have seen that under certain circumstances particles behave like waves. This idea is used in the electron microscope which is a type of microscope that uses electrons to create an image of the target. It has much higher magnification or resolving power than a normal light microscope, up to two million times, allowing it to see smaller objects and details.


Let's first review how a regular optical microscope works.  A beam of light is shone through a thin target and the image is then magnified and focused using objective and ocular lenses. The amount of light  which passes through the target depends on the densities of the target since the less dense regions allow more light to pass through than the denser regions. This means that the beam of light which is partially transmitted through the target carries information about the inner structure of the target. 

The original form of the electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, works in a similar manner using electrons. In the electron microscope, electrons which are emitted by a cathode are formed into a beam using magnetic lenses. This electron beam is then passed through a very thin target. Again, the regions in the target with higher densities stop the electrons more easily. So, the number of electrons which pass through the different regions of the target depends on their densities. This means that the partially transmitted beam of electrons carries information about the densities of the inner structure of the target. The spatial variation in this information (the "image") is then magnified by a series of magnetic lenses and it is recorded by hitting a fluorescent screen, photographic plate, or light sensitive sensor such as a CCD (charge-coupled device) camera. The image detected by the CCD may be displayed in real time on a monitor or computer. In figure \ref{fig:polio} is an image of the polio virus obtained with a transmission electron microscope.

The structure of an optical and electron microscope are compared in figure \ref{fig:p:wsl:wnm12:lvsem}. While the optical microscope uses light and focuses using lenses, the electron microscope uses electrons and focuses using electromagnets.

Electron microscopes are very useful as they are able to magnify objects to a much higher resolution. This is because their de Broglie wavelengths are so much smaller than that of visible light. You hopefully remember that light is diffracted by objects which are separated by a distance of about the same size as the wavelength of the light. This diffraction then prevents you from being able to focus the transmitted light into an image. So the sizes at which diffraction occurs for a beam of electrons is much smaller than those for visible light. This is why you can magnify targets to a much higher order of magnification using electrons rather than visible light.

\Extension{High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM)}{

There are high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) which have been built. In fact the resolution is sufficient to show carbon atoms in diamond separated by only 89 picometers and atoms in silicon at 78 picometers. This is at magnifications of 50 million times. The ability to determine the positions of atoms within materials has made the HRTEM a very useful tool for nano-technologies research. It is also very important for the development of semiconductor devices for electronics and photonics.

Transmission electron microscopes produce two-dimensional images.}

\Extension{Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)}{
The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) produces images by hitting the target with a primary electron beam which then excites the surface of the target. This causes secondary electrons to be emitted from the surface which are then detected.  So the electron beam in the SEM is moved (or scanned) across the sample, while detectors build an image from the secondary electrons.

Generally, the transmission electron microscope's resolution is about an order of magnitude better than the SEM resolution. However, because the SEM image relies on surface processes rather than transmission it is able to image bulk samples (unlike optical microscopes and TEM which require the samples to be thin) and has a much greater depth of view, and so can produce images that are a good representation of the 3D structure of the sample.}

\subsection{Disadvantages of an Electron Microscope}
Electron microscopes are expensive to buy and maintain. They are also very sensitive to vibration and external magnetic fields. This means that special facilities are required to house microscopes aimed at achieving high resolutions. Also the targets have to be viewed in vacuum, as the electrons would scatter off the molecules that make up air. 

\Extension{Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)}{
Scanning electron microscopes usually image conductive or semi-conductive materials best.  A common preparation technique is to coat the target with a several-nanometer layer of conductive material, such as gold, from a sputtering machine; however this process has the potential to disturb delicate samples.

The targets have to be prepared in many ways to give proper detail. This may result in artifacts purely as a result of the treatment. This gives the problem of distinguishing artifacts from material, particularly in biological samples. Scientists maintain that the results from various preparation techniques have been compared, and as there is no reason that they should all produce similar artifacts, it is therefore reasonable to believe that electron microscopy features correlate with living cells.}

\begin{IFact}
{The first electron microscope prototype was built in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll. It was based on the ideas and discoveries of Louis de Broglie. Although it was primitive and was not ideal for practical use, the instrument was still capable of magnifying objects by four hundred times. The first practical electron microscope was built at the University of Toronto in 1938, by Eli Franklin Burton and students Cecil Hall, James Hillier and Albert Prebus.

Although modern electron microscopes can magnify objects up to two million times, they are still based upon Ruska's prototype and his correlation between wavelength and resolution. The electron microscope is an integral part of many laboratories. Researchers use it to examine biological materials (such as microorganisms and cells), a variety of large molecules, medical biopsy samples, metals and crystalline structures, and the characteristics of various surfaces.}
\end{IFact}

\subsection{Uses of Electron Microscopes}
Electron microscopes can be used to study:
\begin{itemize}
\item the topography of an object $-$ how its surface looks.
\item the morphology of particles making up an object  $-$ their shapes and sizes.
\item the composition of an object $-$ the elements and compounds that the object is composed of and the relative amounts of them.
\item the crystallographic information for crystalline samples $-$ how the atoms are arranged in the object.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Electrodynamics - Grade 12}
\label{p:em:ed12}



\section{Introduction}
In Grade 11 you learnt how a magnetic field is generated around a current carrying conductor. You also learnt how a current is generated in a conductor that moves in a magnetic field. This chapter describes how conductors moving in a magnetic field are applied in the real-world.

%\item Learners must be able to give examples of the use of motors
%\end{syllabus}

We have seen that when a conductor is moved in a magnetic field or when a magnet is moved near a conductor, a current flows in the conductor. The amount of current depends on the speed at which the conductor experiences a changing magnetic field, the number of turns of the conductor and the position of the plane of the conductor with respect to the magnetic field. The effect of the orientation of the conductor with respect to the magnetic field is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:conductor}.

If the current flowing in the conductor were plotted as a function of the angle between the plane of the conductor and the magnetic field, then the current would vary as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ac}. The current alternates about zero and is known as an \textit{alternating current} (abbreviated AC).

Recall Faraday's Law which you learnt about in Grade 11:

\Definition{Faraday's Law}{The emf (electromotive force),
$\epsilon$, produced around a loop of conductor is proportional to
the rate of change of the magnetic flux, $\phi$, through the area,
$A$, of the loop. This can be stated mathematically as:
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon=-N\frac{\Delta \phi}{\Delta t}
\end {equation*}
 where $\phi=B\cdot A$ and $B$ is the strength of the magnetic field.}

Faraday's Law relates induced emf (electromotive force) to the rate of change of flux,
which is the product of the magnetic field and the cross-sectional
area the field lines pass through.
As the closed loop conductor changes orientation with respect to the magnetic field, the amount of magnetic flux through the area of the loop changes, and an emf is induced in the conducting loop. 


\subsection{Electrical generators}

\subsection*{AC generator}
The principle of rotating a conductor in a magnetic field is used in electrictrical generators. A generator converts mechanical energy (motion) into electrical energy.
 
\Definition{Generator}{A generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.}

The layout of a simple AC generator is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ACgen}. The conductor in the shape of a coil is connected to a slip ring. The conductor is then manually rotated in the magnetic field generating an alternating emf. The slip rings are connected to the load via brushes.

If a machine is constructed to rotate a magnetic field around a set of stationary wire coils with the turning of a shaft, AC voltage will be produced across the wire coils as that shaft is rotated, in accordance with Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction. This is the basic operating principle of an AC generator.\\
 
In an AC generator the two ends of the coil are each attached to a slip ring that makes contact with brushes as the coil turns. The direction of the current changes with every half turn of the coil. As one side of the loop moves to the other pole of the magnetic field, the current in the loop changes direction. The two slip rings of the AC generator allow the coil to turn without breaking the connections to the load circuit. This type of current which changes direction is known as alternating current.\\  
 
\begin{IFact}{AC generators are also known as alternators. They are found in motor cars to charge the car battery.}
\end{IFact}

\subsection*{DC generator}
A simple DC generator is constructed the same way as an AC generator except that there is one slip ring which is split into two pieces, called a commutator, so the current in the external circuit does not change direction. The layout of a DC generator is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DCgen}. The split-ring commutator accommodates for the change in direction of the current in the loop, thus creating direct current (DC) current going through the brushes and out to the circuit.

\subsection*{AC versus DC generators}

The problems involved with making and breaking electrical contact with a moving coil are sparking and heat, especially if the generator is turning at high speed. If the atmosphere surrounding the machine contains flammable or explosive vapors, the practical problems of spark-producing brush contacts are even greater.\\
 
If the magnetic field, rather than the coil/conductor is rotated, then brushes are not needed in an AC generator (alternator), so an alternator will not have the same problems as DC generators. 
The same benefits of AC over DC for generator design also apply to electric motors.
While DC motors need brushes to make electrical contact with moving coils of wire, AC motors do not. In fact, AC and DC motor designs are very similar to their generator counterparts. 
The AC motor is depends on the reversing magnetic field produced by alternating current through its stationary coils of wire to make the magnet rotate. The DC motor depends on the brush contacts making and breaking
connections to reverse current through the rotating coil every 1/2 rotation (180 degrees).


\subsection{Electric motors}
The basic principles of operation for a motor are the same as that of a generator, except that a motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy (motion).

\Definition{Motor}{An electric motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.}

If one were to place a moving charged particle in a magnetic field, it would feel a force called the \textbf{Lorentz force}. 

\Definition{The Lorentz Force}{The Lorentz force is the force experienced by a moving charged particle in a magnetic field and can be described by:
\begin{equation*}
F = q \times v \times B
\end{equation*}
where \\
$F$ is the force (in newtons, N) \\
$q$ is the electric charge (in coulombs, C) \\
$v$ is the velocity of the charged particle (in $\rm{m.s^{-1}}$) and \\
$B$ is the magnetic field strength (in teslas, T). 
}

Current in a conductor consists of moving charges. Therefore, a current carrying coil in a magnetic field will also feel the Lorentz force. For a straight current carrying wire which is not moving:

\begin{equation*}
F = I \times L \times B
\end{equation*}
where \\
$F$ is the force (in newtons, N) \\
$I$ is the current in the wire (in amperes, A) \\
$L$ is the length of the wire which is in the magnetic field (in m) and \\
$B$ is the magnetic field strength (in teslas, T). \\

The direction of the Lorentz force is perpendicular to both the direction of the flow of current and the magnetic field and can be found using the \textbf{Right Hand Rule} as shown in the picture below. Use your \textit{right hand}; your thumb points in the direction of the current, your first finger in the direction of the magnetic field and your third finger will then point in the direction of the force.

Both motors and generators can be explained in terms of a coil that rotates in a magnetic field. In a generator the coil is attached to an external circuit that is turned, resulting in a changing flux that induces an emf. In a motor, a current-carrying coil in a magnetic field experiences a force on both sides of the coil, creating a twisting force (called a \textit{torque}, pronounce like 'talk') which makes it turn.\\

Any coil carrying current can feel a force in a magnetic field. The force is the Lorentz force on the moving charges in the conductor. The force on opposite sides of the coil will be in opposite directions because the charges are moving in opposite directions. This means the coil will rotate, see the picture below:

Instead of rotating the loops through a magnetic field to create electricity, a current is sent through the wires, creating electromagnets. The outer magnets will then repel the electromagnets and rotate the shaft as an electric motor. If the current is AC, the two slip rings are required to create an AC motor. An AC motor is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ACmotor}

\subsection{Real-life applications}

\subsubsection{Cars}
A car contains an alternator that charges its battery and powers the car's electric system when its engine is running. Alternators have the great advantage over direct-current generators of not using a commutator, which makes them simpler, lighter, less costly, and more rugged than a DC generator.

\Activity{Research Topic}{Alternators}
{Try to find out the different ampere values produced by alternators for different types of machines. Compare these to understand what numbers make sense in the real world. You will find different numbers for cars, trucks, buses, boats etc. Try to find out what other machines might have alternators.
}

A car also contains a DC electric motor, the starter motor, to turn over the engine to start it.
A starter motor consists of the very powerful DC electric motor and starter solenoid that is attached to the motor.
A starter motor requires a very high current to crank the engine, that's why it's connected to the battery with large cables. 

\subsubsection{Electricity Generation}

AC generators are mainly used in the real-world to generate electricity.\\

\section{Alternating Current}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item Learners must be able to Explain the advantages of alternating current
%\item Learners must be able to Write expressions for the current and voltage in an AC circuit
%\item Learners must be able to Define the rms (root mean square) values for current and voltage as Irms.  =   and Vrms.  =  respectively, and explain why these values are useful.
%\item Learners must be able to Draw a graph of voltage vs time and current vs time for an AC circuit.
%\item Note: The main advantage to AC is that the voltage can be changed using transformers.  That means that the voltage can be stepped up at power stations to a very high voltage so that electrical energy can be transmitted along power lines at low current and therefore experience low energy loss due to heating.  The voltage can then be stepped down for use in buildings, street lights, and so forth.
%\end{syllabus}

Most students learning about electricity begin with what is known as \textit{direct current} (DC), which is electricity flowing in a constant direction. DC is the kind of electricity made by a battery, with definite positive and negative terminals.\\ 
 
However, we have seen that the electricity produced by some generators alternates and is therefore known as \textit{alternating current} (AC). The main advantage to AC is that the voltage can be changed using transformers.  That means that the voltage can be stepped up at power stations to a very high voltage so that electrical energy can be transmitted along power lines at low current and therefore experience low energy loss due to heating.  The voltage can then be stepped down for use in buildings and street lights.

In an ideal DC circuit the current and voltage are constant. In an AC circuit the current and voltage vary with time. The value of the current or voltage at any specific time is called the \textit{instantaneous current or voltage} and is calculated as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
i&=&I_{max}\sin(2\pi f t + \phi)\\
v&=&V_{max}\sin(2\pi f t)
\end{eqnarray*}\\
 
$i$ is the instantaneous current. $I_{max}$ is the maximum current. $v$ is the instantaneous voltage. $V_{max}$ is the maximum voltage. $f$ is the frequency of the AC and $t$ is the time at which the instantaneous current or voltage is being calculated.\\
The average value we use for AC is known as the root mean square (rms) average. This is defined as:
\begin{eqnarray*}
I_{rms}&=&\frac{I_{max}}{\sqrt{2}}\\
V_{rms}&=&\frac{V_{max}}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}\\
Since AC varies sinusoidally, with as much positive as negative, doing a straight average would get you zero for the average voltage. The rms value by-passes this problem.

\section{Capacitance and inductance}
%\begin{syllabus}

%\end{syllabus}

Capacitors and inductors are found in many circuits. Capacitors store an electric field, and are used as temporary power sources as well as to minimize power fluctuations in major circuits. Inductors work in conjunction with capacitors for electrical signal processing. Here we explain the physics and applications of both.

\subsection{Capacitance}
You have learnt about capacitance and capacitors in Grade 11. %Please read through Chapter~\ref{p:em:es11:c} to recap what you learnt about capacitance in a DC circuit.\\ 
 
In this section you will learn about capacitance in an AC circuit. A capacitor in an AC circuit has \textit{reactance}. Reactance in an AC circuit plays a similar role to resistance in a DC circuit. The reactance of a capacitor $X_C$ is defined as:\\
\begin{equation*}
X_C=\frac{1}{2\pi fC}
\end{equation*}
where $C$ is the capacitance and $f$ is the AC frequency.\\
 
If we examine the equation for the reactance of a capacitor, we see that the frequency is in the denominator. Therefore, when the frequency is low, the capacitive reactance is very high. This is why a capacitor blocks the flow of DC and low frequency AC because its reactance increases with decreasing frequency.\\ 
 
When the frequency is high, the capacitive reactance is low. This is why a capacitor allows the flow of high frequency AC because its reactance decreases with increasing frequency.


\subsection{Inductance}

Inductance (measured in henries, symbol H) is a measure of the generated emf for a unit change in current. For example, an inductor with an inductance of 1~H produces an emf of 1~V when the current through the inductor changes at the rate of 1~A$\cdot$s$^{-1}$.\\ 

An inductor is a passive electrical device used in electrical circuits for its property of inductance. An inductor is usually made as a coil (or solenoid) of conducting material, typically copper wire, wrapped around a core either of air or of ferromagnetic material.\\ 
 
Electrical current through the conductor creates a magnetic flux proportional to the current. A change in this current creates a change in magnetic flux that, in turn, generates an emf that acts to oppose this change in current.\\ 

 
The inductance of an inductor is determined by several factors:
\begin{itemize}
\item the shape of the coil; a short, fat coil has a higher inductance than one that is thin and tall.
\item the material that the conductor is wrapped around. 
\item how the conductor is wound; winding in opposite directions will cancel out the inductance effect, and you will have only a resistor.
\end{itemize}

The inductance of a solenoid is defined by:\\
 \begin{equation*}
L=\frac{\mu_0 A N^2}{l}
 \end{equation*}
where $\mu_0$ is the permeability of the core material (in this case air), $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the solenoid, $N$ is the number of turns and $l$ is the length of the solenoid. 

\Definition{Permeability}{Permeability is the property of a material which describes the magnetisation developed in that material when excited by a source.}

\begin{IFact}{The permeability of free space is $4 \pi \times 10^{-7}$ henry per metre.}
\end{IFact}

\begin{wex}{Inductance I}{Determine the inductance of a coil with a core material of air. A cross-sectional area of $0,3\rm{m^2}$, with 1000 turns and a length of 0,1~m}
{
\westep{Determine how to approach the problem}
We are calculating inductance, so we use the equation:
\begin{eqnarray*}
L=\frac{\mu_0 A N^2}{l}\\
\end{eqnarray*}\\
The permeability is that for free space:$4 \pi \textrm{x} 10^{-7}$ henry per metre.

\westep{Solve the problem}
\begin{eqnarray*}
L&=&\frac{\mu_0 A N^2}{l}\\
&=&\frac{(4 \pi \times 10^{-7})(0,3)(1000)}{0,1}\\ 
&=&3,8 \times 10^{-3} \textrm H/m\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Write the final answer}
The inductance of the coil is $3,8\times 10^{-3}$~H/m.}
\end{wex}

\begin{wex}{Inductance II}{Calculate the inductance of a 5~cm long solenoid with a diameter of 4~mm and 2000 turns.
}
{Again this is an inductance problem, so we use the same formula as the worked example above.\\
 
$$\textrm{r} = \frac{4 \textrm{ mm}}{2} = 2 \textrm{ mm} = 0,002 \textrm{ m}$$
$$\textrm{A} = \pi \textrm{r}^2 = \pi \times 0,002^2$$

\begin{eqnarray*}
\textrm{L} & = & \frac{\mu_0 \textrm{A} \textrm{N}^2}{l}\\
& = & \frac{4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \times 0,002^2 \times \pi \times 2000^2}{0,05}\\
& = & 0,00126 \textrm{ H}\\
& = & 1,26\textrm{ mH}\\
\end{eqnarray*}
}

\end{wex}

An inductor in an AC circuit also has a reactance, $X_L$. Reactance is the property of an inductor that opposes the flow of AC current. Reactance is defined by:

\begin{equation*}
X_L = 2\pi fL
\end{equation*}
 
where $L$ is the inductance and $f$ is the frequency of the AC.\\
 
If we examine the equation for the reactance of an inductor, we see that inductive reactance increases with increasing frequency. Therefore, when the frequency is low, the inductive reactance is very low. This is why an inductor allows the flow of DC and low frequency AC because its reactance decreases with decreasing frequency.\\ 
 
When the frequency is high, the inductive reactance is high. This is why an inductor blocks the flow of high frequency AC because its reactance increases with increasing frequency.

\chapter{Electronics - Grade 12}
\label{p:em:el12}

%\nts{Status: Ready for evaulation.  Dynamic references need adding where previous chapters are referred to.}

\section{Introduction}
Electronics and electrical devices surround us in daily life. From the street lights and water pumps to computers and digital phones, electronics have enabled the digital revolution to occur. All electronics are built on a backbone of simple circuits, and so an understanding of circuits is vital in understanding more complex devices.

This chapter will explain the basic physics principles of many of the components of electronic devices.  We will begin with an explanation of capacitors and inductors. We see how these are used in tuning a radio.  Next, we look at {\bf active} components such as transistors and operational amplifiers. Lastly, the chapter will finish with an explanation of digital electronics, including logic gates and counting circuits. 

Before studying this chapter, you will want to remind yourself of:
\begin{itemize}
%\item The meaning of voltage ($V$), current ($I$) and resistance ($R$), as covered in Grade 10 (see chapter~\ref{p:ElecCircuitsG10}), and Grade 11 (see chapter~\ref{p:em:ec11}).
\item The meaning of voltage ($V$), current ($I$) and resistance ($R$), as covered in Grade 10, and Grade 11.
\item Capacitors in electric circuits, as covered in Grade 11 (see section 17.6).
\item Semiconductors, as covered in Grade 11 (see chapter 20).
\item The meaning of an alternating current (see section 28.3).
\item Capacitance ($C$) and Inductance ($L$) (see section 28.4).
\end{itemize}
%\nts{Dynamic references need to be put in place to direct the reader to the other chapters.}

\section{Capacitive and Inductive Circuits}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to Perform calculations on capacitive circuits using the formula:	$V^2  =  I^2(R^2 + X_C^2)$
%\item The learner must be able to Understand that in a circuit containing both resistive and reactive components, the ratio $\frac{V}{I}$ is neither pure resistance nor pure reactance.  The ratio is called impedance, $Z$, where $Z  = \sqrt{R^2+X_C^2}$ and is measured in $\Omega$ s.
%\item The learner must be able to Understand that any coil has inductance, but also resistance.  So a coil can be considered as a resistance and an inductance in series.  The impedance of an inductor is given by: $Z  = \sqrt{R^2+X_L^2}$
%\end{syllabus}

Earlier in Grade 12, you were shown alternating currents (AC) and you saw that the voltage and the current varied with time.  If the AC supply is connected to a resistor, then the current and voltage will be proportional to each other.  This means that the current and voltage will `peak' at the same time.  We say that the current and voltage are {\bf in phase}.  This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:VIres}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{center}
\end{figure}

When a capacitor is connected to an alternating voltage, the maximum voltage is proportional to the maximum current, but the maximum voltage does not occur at the same time as the maximum current.  The current has its maximum (it peaks) one quarter of a cycle before the voltage peaks.  Engineers say that the `current leads the voltage by $90^{\circ}$'.  This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:VIcap}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{center}
\end{figure}

For a circuit with a capacitor, the instantaneous value of $\frac{V}{I}$ is not constant.  However, the value of $\frac{V_{\mathrm{max}}}{I_{\mathrm{max}}}$ is useful, and is called the {\bf capacitive reactance} ($X_{C}$) of the component.  Because it is still a voltage divided by a current (like resistance), its unit is the ohm.  The value of $X_{C}$ ($C$ standing for capacitor) depends on its capacitance ($C$) and the frequency ($f$) of the alternating current (in South Africa 50 Hz).

\equ{X_{C} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{max}}}{I_{\mathrm{max}}} = \frac{1}{2 \pi f C}}{eq:xc}

Inductors are very similar, but the current peaks $90^{\circ}$ after the voltage.  This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:VIind}.  Engineers say that the `current lags the voltage'.  Again, the ratio of maximum voltage to maximum current is called the reactance --- this time inductive reactance ($X_{L}$).  The value of the reactance depends on its inductance ($L$).

\equ{X_{L} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{max}}}{I_{\mathrm{max}}} = 2 \pi f L}{eq:xl}

\caption{The current peaks (has its maximum) one quarter of a wave after the voltage when an inductor is connected to an alternating voltage.}
\label{fig:VIind}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\Definition{Reactance}{The ratio of the maximum voltage to the maximum current when a capacitor or inductor is connected to an alternating voltage.  The unit of reactance is the ohm.}

While inductive and capacitive reactances are similar, in one sense they are opposites.  For an inductor, the current peaks $90^{\circ}$ {\bf after} the voltage.  For a capacitor the current peaks $90^{\circ}$ {\bf ahead} of the voltage.  When we work out the total reactance for an inductor and a capacitor in series, we use the formula
\equ{X_{\mathrm{total}} = X_{L} - X_{C}}{eq:xtotal}

to take this into account.  This formula can also be used when there is more than one inductor or more than one capacitor in the circuit.  The total reactance is the sum of all of the inductive reactances minus the sum of all the capacitive reactances.  The magnitude (number) in the final result gives the ratio of maximum voltage to maximum current in the circuit as a whole.  The sign of the final result tells you its phase.  If it is positive, the current peaks $90^{\circ}$ after the voltage, if it is negative, the current peaks $90^{\circ}$ before the voltage.


If a series circuit contains resistors as well, then the situation is more complicated.  The maximum current is still proportional to the maximum voltage, but the phase difference between them won't be $90^{\circ}$.  The ratio between the maximum voltage and maximum current is called the {\bf impedance} ($Z$), and its unit is also the ohm.  Impedances are calculated using this formula:
\equ{Z = \sqrt{X^{2} + R^{2}}}{eq:z}

where $X$ is the total reactance of the inductors and capacitors in the circuit, and $R$ is the total resistance of the resistors in the circuit.


It is easier to understand this formula by thinking of a right angled triangle.  Resistances are drawn horizontally, reactances are drawn vertically.  The hypotenuse of the triangle gives the impedance.  This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:XRZtriangle}.

\Definition{Impedance}{The maximum voltage divided by the maximum current for any circuit. The unit of impedance is the ohm.}

It is important to remember that when resistors and inductances (or capacitors) are in a circuit, the current will not be in phase with the voltage, so the impedance is not  a resistance.  Similarly the current won't be exactly $90^{\circ}$ out of phase with the voltage so the impedance isn't a reactance either.

\begin{wex}{The impedance of a coil}{Calculate the maximum current in a coil in a South African motor which has a resistance of 5 $\Omega$ and an inductance of 3 mH.

\begin{IFact}{Most factories containing heavy duty electrical equipment (e.g. large motors) have to pay extra money to their electricity supply company because the inductance of the motor coils causes the current and voltage to get out of phase.  As this makes the electricity distribution network less efficient, a financial penalty is incurred.  The factory engineer can prevent this by connecting capacitors into the circuit to reduce the reactance to zero, as in the last question above.  The current and voltage are then in phase again.  We can't calculate the capacitance needed in this chapter, because the capacitors are usually connected in parallel, and we have only covered the reactances and impedances of series circuits.} \end{IFact}

\subsection{Capacitors and Inductors as Filters}
We have already seen how capacitors and inductors pass current more easily at certain frequencies than others. To recap: if we examine the equation for the reactance of a capacitor, we see that the frequency is in the denominator. Therefore, when the frequency is low, the capacitive reactance is very high. This is why a capacitor blocks the flow of DC and low frequency AC because its reactance increases with decreasing frequency. 


When the frequency is high, the capacitive reactance is low. This is why a capacitor allows the flow of high frequency AC because its reactance decreases with increasing frequency.


Therefore putting a capacitor in a circuit blocks the low frequencies and allows the high frequencies to pass.  This is called a high pass filter.  A filter like this can be used in the `treble' setting of a sound mixer or music player which controls the amount of high frequency signal reaching the speaker.  The more high frequency signal there is, the `tinnier' the sound.  A simple high pass filter circuit is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hipass}.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

Similarly, if we examine the equation for the reactance of an inductor, we see that inductive reactance increases with increasing frequency. Therefore, when the frequency is low, the inductive reactance is very low. This is why an inductor allows the flow of DC and low frequency AC because its reactance decreases with decreasing frequency. 


When the frequency is high, the inductive reactance is high. This is why an inductor blocks the flow of high frequency AC because its reactance increases with increasing frequency.


Therefore putting an inductor in a circuit blocks the high frequencies and allows the low frequencies to pass.  This is called a low pass filter.  A filter like this can be used in the `bass' setting of a sound mixer or music player which controls the amount of low frequency signal reaching the speaker.  The more low frequency signal there is, the more the sound `booms'.  A simple low pass filter circuit is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lopass}.

\subsection{LRC Circuits, Resonance and Signal Tuning}
A circuit containing a resistor, a capacitor and an inductor all in series is called an LRC circuit.  Because the components are in series, the current through each component at a particular time will be the same as the current through the others.  The voltage across the resistor will be in phase with the current.  The voltage across the inductor will be $90^{\circ}$ ahead of the current (the current always follows or lags the voltage in an inductor).  The voltage across the capacitor will be $90^{\circ}$ behind the current (the current leads the voltage for a capacitor).  The phases of the voltages for the inductor and capacitor relative to the common current are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:VLCR}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{The voltages across the separate components of an LRC circuit. Looking at the peaks, you see that the voltage across the inductor $V_{L}$ `peaks' first, followed $90^{\circ}$ later by the current $I$, followed $90^{\circ}$ later by the voltage across the capacitor $V_{C}$.  The voltage across the resistor is not shown --- it is in phase with the current and peaks at the same time as the current.}
\label{fig:VLCR}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


The reactance of the inductor is $2 \pi f L$, and the reactance of the capacitor is $1 / 2 \pi f C$ but with the opposite phase.  So the total reactance of the LRC circuit is 
\nequ{X = X_{L} - X_{C} = 2 \pi f L - \frac{1}{2 \pi f C}}
The impedance of the circuit as a whole is given by
\nequ{Z = \sqrt{X^{2} + R^{2}} = \sqrt{\left( 2 \pi f L - \frac{1}{2 \pi f C} \right)^{2} + R^{2}}}
At different frequencies, the impedance will take different values.  The impedance will have its smallest value when the positive inductive reactance cancels out the negative capacitive reactance.  This occurs when
\nequ{2 \pi f L = \frac{1}{2 \pi f C}}
so the frequency of minimum impedance must be
\nequ{f = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{LC}}}
This is called the {\bf resonant frequency} of the circuit.  This is the frequency at which you can get the largest current for a particular supply voltage.  It is also called the {\bf natural frequency} of the circuit.  This means the frequency at which the circuit would oscillate by itself.

\Definition{Resonance}{Resonance occurs when a circuit is connected to an alternating voltage at its natural frequency. A very large current can build up in the circuit, even with minimal power input.}

An LRC circuit is very useful when we have a signal containing many different frequencies, and we only want one of them.  If a mixed signal like this is connected to an LRC circuit, then only the resonant frequency (and other frequencies close to it) will drive measureable currents.  This means that an LRC circuit can select one frequency from a range.  This process is called {\bf signal tuning}.

\begin{IFact}{When you set up a radio antenna, and amplify the radio signal it receives, you find many different bands of frequencies --- one from each radio station.  When you listen to the radio, you only want to listen to one station.  An LRC circuit in the radio (the tuning circuit) is set so that its resonant frequency is the frequency of the station you want to listen to.  This means that of the many radio stations broadcasting, you only hear one.  When you adjust the tuning dial on the radio, it changes the capacitance of the capacitor in the tuning circuit.  This changes the resonant frequency, and this changes the radio station that you will hear.}\end{IFact}

\section{Active Circuit Elements}

The components you have been learning about so far --- resistors, capacitors and inductors --- are called {\bf passive} components.  They do not change their behaviour or physics and therefore always have the same response to changes in voltage or current.  {\bf Active} components are quite different.  Their response to changes in input allows them to make amplifiers, calculators and computers.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

A full explanation of diode operation is complex.  Here is a simplified description.  The diode consists of two semiconductor blocks attached together.  Neither block is made of pure silicon --- they are both {\bf doped}.  Doping was described in more detail in Section 10.3. 
%\nts{A proper, dynamic reference needs to be given here}  

In short, p-type semiconductor has fewer free electrons than normal semiconductor.  `P' stands for `positive', meaning a lack of electrons, although the material is actually neutral.  The locations where electrons are missing are called {\bf holes}.  This material can conduct electricity well, because electrons can move into the holes, making a new hole somewhere else in the material.  Any extra electrons introduced into this region by the circuit will fill some or all of the holes.  

In n-type semiconductor, the situation is reversed.  The material has more free electrons than normal semiconductor.  `N' stands for `negative', meaning an excess of electrons, although the material is actually neutral.

When a p-type semiconductor is attached to an n-type semiconductor, some of the free electrons in the n-type move across to the p-type semiconductor.  They fill the available holes near the junction.  This means that the region of the n-type semiconductor nearest the junction has no free electrons (they've moved across to fill the holes).  This makes this n-type semiconductor positively charged.  It used to be electrically neutral, but has since lost electrons.

The region of p-type semiconductor nearest the junction now has no holes (they've been filled in by the migrating electrons).   This makes the p-type semiconductor negatively charged.  It used to be electrically neutral, but has since gained electrons.  

Without free electrons or holes, the central region can not conduct electricity well.  It has a high resistance, and is called the {\bf depletion band}.  This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:deplayer}.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

You can explain the high resistance in a different way.  A free electron in the n-type semiconductor will be repelled from the p-type semiconductor because of its negative charge.  The electron will not go into the depletion band, and certainly won't cross the band to the p-type semiconductor.  You may ask, ``But won't a free electron in the p-type semiconductor be attracted across the band, carrying a current?''  But there are no free electrons in p-type semiconductor, so no current of this kind can flow.

If the diode is reverse-biased, the $+$ terminal of the battery is connected to the n-type semiconductor.  This makes it even more negatively charged.  It also removes even more of the free electrons near the depletion band.  At the same time, the $-$ terminal of the battery is connected to the p-type silicon.  This will supply free electrons and fill in more of the holes next to the depletion band.  Both processes cause the depletion band to get wider.  The resistance of the diode (which was already high) increases.  This is why a reverse-biased diode does not conduct.

Another explanation for the increased resistance is that the battery has made the p-type semiconductor {\it more negative} than it used to be, making it repel any electrons from the n-type semiconductor which attempt to cross the depletion band.

On the other hand, if the diode is forward biased, the depletion band is made narrower.  The negative charge on the p-type silicon is cancelled out by the battery.  The greater the voltage used, the narrower the depletion band becomes.  Eventually, when the voltage is about 0,6 V (for silicon) the depletion band disappears.  Once this has occurred, the diode conducts very well.

\subsection{The Light-Emitting Diode (LED)}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to Describe the LED as a diode that emits light when conducting.
%\item The learner must be able to Give examples of the use LEDs in everyday life
%\end{syllabus}

A light-emitting diode (LED) is a diode device that emits light when charge flows in the correct direction through it. If you apply a voltage to force current to flow in the direction the LED allows, it will light up.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../ledsym.eps}
\caption{Symbol for a light-emitting diode with anode and cathode labeled.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\Extension{Circuit Symbols}{This notation of having two small arrows pointing away from the device is common to the schematic symbols of all light-emitting semiconductor devices. Conversely, if a device is light-activated (meaning that incoming light stimulates it), then the symbol will have two small arrows pointing toward it. It is interesting to note, though, that LEDs are capable of acting as light-sensing devices: they will generate a small voltage when exposed to light, much like a solar cell on a small scale. This property can be gainfully applied in a variety of light-sensing circuits.}

The colour depends on the semiconducting material used to construct the LED, and can be in the near-ultraviolet, visible or infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
 
\begin{IFact}{Nick Holonyak Jr. (1928) of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign developed the first practical visible-spectrum LED in 1962.}
\end{IFact}

\subsubsection{Light emission}
The wavelength of the light emitted, and therefore its colour, depends on the materials forming the p-n junction. A normal diode, typically made of silicon or germanium, emits invisible far-infrared light (so it can't be seen), but the materials used for an LED can emit light corresponding to near-infrared, visible or near-ultraviolet frequencies.

\subsubsection{LED applications}
LEDs have many uses.  Some of these are given here.
\begin{itemize}
\item thin, lightweight message displays, e.g. in public information signs (at airports and railway stations, among other places)
\item status indicators, e.g. on/off lights on professional instruments and consumers audio/video equipment
\item infrared LEDs in remote controls (for TVs, VCRs, etc.)
\item clusters of LEDs are used in traffic signals, replacing ordinary bulbs behind coloured glass
\item car indicator lights and bicycle lighting
\item calculator and measurement instrument displays (seven segment displays), although now mostly replaced by LCDs
\item red or yellow LEDs are used in indicator and [alpha]numeric displays in environments where night vision must be retained: aircraft cockpits, submarine and ship bridges, astronomy observatories, and in the field, e.g. night time animal watching and military field use
\item red or yellow LEDs are also used in photographic darkrooms, for providing lighting which does not lead to unwanted exposure of the film
\item illumination, e.g. flashlights (a.k.a. torches, UK), and backlighting for LCD screens
\item signaling/emergency beacons and strobes
\item movement sensors, e.g. in mechanical and optical computer mice and trackballs
\item in LED printers, e.g. high-end colour printers
\end{itemize}

LEDs offer benefits in terms of maintenance and safety.

\begin{itemize}
\item The typical working lifetime of a device, including the bulb, is ten years, which is much longer than the lifetimes of most other light sources.
\item LEDs fail by dimming over time, rather than the abrupt burn-out of incandescent bulbs.
\item LEDs give off less heat than incandescent light bulbs and are less fragile than fluorescent lamps.
\item Since an individual device is smaller than a centimetre in length, LED-based light sources used for illumination and outdoor signals are built using clusters of tens of devices.
\end{itemize}

Because they are monochromatic, LED lights have great power advantages over white lights where a specific colour is required. Unlike the white lights, the LED does not need a filter that absorbs most of the emitted white light. Coloured fluorescent lights are made, but they are not widely available. LED lights are inherently coloured, and are available in a wide range of colours. One of the most recently introduced colours is the emerald green (bluish green, wavelength of about 500 nm) that meets the legal requirements for traffic signals and navigation lights. 

\begin{IFact}{The largest LED display in the world is 36~m high, at Times Square, New York, U.S.A.}
\end{IFact}

There are applications that specifically require light that does not contain any blue component. Examples are photographic darkroom safe lights, illumination in laboratories where certain photo-sensitive chemicals are used, and situations where dark adaptation (night vision) must be preserved, such as cockpit and bridge illumination, observatories, etc. Yellow LED lights are a good choice to meet these special requirements because the human eye is more sensitive to yellow light.

\subsection{Transistor}
The diode is the simplest semiconductor device, made up of a p-type semiconductor and an n-type semiconductor in contact. It can conduct in only one direction, but it cannot control the size of an electric current.  Transistors are more complicated electronic components which can control the size of the electric current flowing through them.  

This enables them to be used in amplifiers.  A small signal from a microphone or a radio antenna can be used to control the transistor.  In response, the transistor will then increase and decrease a much larger current which flows through the speakers.

\begin{IFact}{One of the earliest popular uses of transistors was in cheap and portable radios.  Before that, radios were much more expensive and contained glass valves which were fragile and needed replacing.  In some parts of the world you can still hear people talking about their `transistor' --- they mean their portable radio.}\end{IFact}

You can also use a small current to turn the transistor on and off.  The transistor then controls a more complicated or powerful current through other components.  When a transistor is used in this way it is said to be in {\bf switching} mode as it is acting as a remotely controlled switch.  As we shall see in the final sections of this chapter, switching circuits can be used in a computer to process and store digital information.  A computer would not work without the millions (or billions) of transistors in it.

There are two main types of transistor - bipolar transistors (NPN or PNP), and field effect transistors (FETs).  Both use doped semiconductors, but in different ways.  You are mainly required to know about field effect transistors (FETs), however we have to give a brief description of bipolar transistors so that you see the difference.

\subsubsection{Bipolar Transistors}

Bipolar transistors are made of a doped semiconductor `sandwich'.  In an NPN transistor, a very thin layer of p-type semiconductor is in between two thicker layers of n-type semiconductor.  This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:NPNtrans}.  Similarly an PNP transistor consists of a very thin n-type layer in between two thicker layers of p-type semiconductor.

\end{pspicture}
\caption{An NPN transistor.  This is a type of bipolar transistor.}
\label{fig:NPNtrans}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In an NPN transistor a small current of electrons flows from the emitter (E) to the base (B).  Simultaneously, a much larger current of electrons flows from the emitter (E) to the collector (C).  If you lower the number of electrons able to leave the transistor at the base (B), the transistor automatically reduces the number of electrons flowing from emitter (E) to collector (C).  Similarly, if you increase the current of electrons flowing out of the base (B), the transistor automatically also increases the current of electrons flowing from emitter (E) to collector (C).  The transistor is designed so that the current of electrons from emitter to collector ($I_{EC}$) is proportional to the current of electrons from emitter to base ($I_{EB}$).  The constant of proportionality is known as the {\bf current gain} $\beta$.  So $I_{EC} = \beta I_{EB}$.

How does it do it?  The answer comes from our work with diodes.  Electrons arriving at the emitter (n-type semiconductor) will naturally flow through into the central p-type since the base-emitter junction is forward biased.  However if none of these electrons are removed from the base, the electrons flowing into the base from the emitter will fill all of the available `holes'.  Accordingly, a large depletion band will be set up.  This will act as an insulator preventing current flow into the collector as well.  On the other hand, if the base is connected to a positive voltage, a small number of electrons will be removed by the base connection.  This will prevent the `holes' in the base becoming filled up, and no depletion band will form. While some electrons from the emitter leave via the base connection, the bulk of them flow straight on to the collector.  You may wonder how the electrons get from the base into the collector (it seems to be reverse biased).  The answer is complicated, but the important fact is that the p-type layer is extremely thin.  As long as there is no depletion layer, the bulk of the electrons will have no difficulty passing straight from the n-type emitter into the n-type collector.  A more satisfactory answer can be given to a university student once band theory has been explained.

Summing up, in an NPN transistor, a small flow of electrons from emitter (E) to base (B) allows a much larger flow of electrons from emitter (E) to collector (C).  Given that conventional current (flowing from $+$ to $-$) is in the opposite direction to electron flow, we say that a small conventional current from base to emitter allows a large current to flow from collector to emitter.

A PNP transistor works the other way.  A small conventional current from emitter to base allows a much larger conventional current to flow from emitter to collector.  The operation is more complicated to explain since the principal charge carrier in a PNP transistor is not the electron but the `hole'.

The operation of NPN and PNP transistors (in terms of conventional currents) is summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:transcur}.

\begin{IFact}{The transistor is considered by many to be one of the greatest discoveries or inventions in modern history, ranking with banking and the printing press. Key to the importance of the transistor in modern society is its ability to be produced in huge numbers using simple techniques, resulting in vanishingly small prices. Computer ``chips'' consist of millions of transistors and sell for Rands, with per-transistor costs in the thousandths-of-cents. The low cost has meant that the transistor has become an almost universal tool for non-mechanical tasks. Whereas a common device, say a refrigerator, would have used a mechanical device for control, today it is often less expensive to simply use a few million transistors and the appropriate computer program to carry out the same task through "brute force". Today transistors have replaced almost all electromechanical devices, most simple feedback systems, and appear in huge numbers in everything from computers to cars.}\end{IFact} 

\begin{IFact}{The transistor was invented at Bell Laboratories in December 1947 (first demonstrated on December 23) by John Bardeen, Walter Houser Brattain, and William Bradford Shockley, who were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1956.}\end{IFact}

\subsubsection{The Field Effect Transistor (FET)}

To control a bipolar transistor, you control the {\bf current} flowing into or out of its base.  The other type of transistor is the field effect transistor (FET).  FETs work using control {\bf voltages} instead.  Accordingly they can be controlled with much smaller currents and are much more economic to use.  

\begin{IFact}{No-one would build a computer with billions of bipolar transistors --- the current in each transistor's base might be small, but when you add up all of the base currents in the millions of transistors, the computer as a whole would be consuming a great deal of electricity and making a great deal of heat.  Not only is this wasteful, it would prevent manufacturers making a computer of convenient size.  If the transistors were too close together, they would overheat.}\end{IFact}

\end{figure}

The three terminals of the FET are called the \textit{source} (S), \textit{drain} (D) and \textit{gate} (G), as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fet}.  When the gate is not connected, a current of electrons can flow from source (S) to drain (D) easily along the channel.  The source is, accordingly, the negative terminal of the transistor.  The drain, where the electrons come out, is the positive terminal of the transistor.  A few electrons will flow from the n-type channel into the p-type semiconductor of the gate when the device is manufactured.  However, as these electrons are not removed (the gate is not connected), a depletion band is set up which prevents further flow into the gate.

In operation, the gate is connected to negative voltages relative to the source.  This makes the p-n junction between gate and channel reverse-biased.  Accordingly no current flows from the source into the gate.  When the voltage of the gate is lowered (made more negative), the depletion band becomes wider.  This enlarged depletion band takes up some of the space of the channel.  So the lower the voltage of the gate (the more negative it is relative to the source), the larger the depletion band.  The larger the depletion band, the narrower the channel.  The narrower the channel, the harder it is for electrons to flow from source to drain.

The voltage of the gate is not the only factor affecting the current of electrons between the source and the drain.  If the external circuit has a low resistance, electrons are able to leave the drain easily.  If the external circuit has a high resistance, electrons leave the drain slowly.  This creates a kind of `traffic jam' which slows the passage of further electrons.  In this way, the voltage of the drain regulates itself, and is more or less independent of the current demanded from the drain.

Once these two factors have been taken into account, it is fair to say that the positive output voltage (the voltage of the drain relative to the source) is proportional to the negative input voltage (the voltage of the gate relative to the source).

For this reason, the field effect transistor is known as a voltage amplifier.  This contrasts with the bipolar transistor which is a current amplifier.

%\end{syllabus}

The operational amplifier is a special kind of voltage amplifier which is made from a handful of bipolar or field effect transistors.  Operational amplifiers are usually called {\bf op-amps} for short.  They are used extensively in all kinds of audio equipment (amplifiers, mixers and so on) and in instrumentation.  They also have many other uses in other circuits - for example comparing voltages from sensors.

Operational amplifiers are supplied on Integrated Circuits (I.C.s).  The most famous operational amplifier I.C. is numbered 741 and contains a single operational amplifier on an integrated circuit (`chip') with eight terminals.  Other varieties can be bought, and you can get a single integrated circuit with two or four `741'-type operational amplifiers on it.

The symbol for an op-amp is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:opamp}. The operational amplifier has two input terminals and one output terminal.  The voltage of the output terminal is proportional to the difference in voltage between the two input terminals.  The output terminal is on the right (at the sharp point of the triangle).  The two input terminals are drawn on the left.  
One input terminal (labelled with a $+$ on diagrams) is called the {\bf non-inverting input}.  The other input terminal (labelled $-$) is called the {\bf inverting input}.  The labels $+$ and $-$ have nothing to do with the way in which the operational amplifier is connected to the power supply.  Operational amplifiers must be connected to the power supply, but this is taken for granted when circuit diagrams are drawn, and these connections are not shown on circuit diagrams.  Usually, when drawing electronic circuits, `0V' is taken to mean the negative terminal of the power supply.  This is not the case with op-amps.  For an op-amp, `0V' refers to the voltage midway between the $+$ and $-$ of the supply.

\label{fig:opamp}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The output voltage of the amplifier $V_{out}$ is given by the formula
\equ{V_{out} = A \left( V_{+} - V_{-} \right)}
where $A$ is a constant called the {\bf open loop gain}, and $V_{+}$ and $V_{-}$ are the voltages of the two input terminals.  That said, the output voltage can not be less than the voltage of the negative terminal of the battery supplying it or higher than the positive terminal of the battery supplying it.  You will notice that $V_{out}$ is positive if $V_{+} > V_{-}$ and negative if $V_{+} < V_{-}$.  This is why the $-$ input is called the inverting input: raising its voltage causes the output voltage to {\it drop}.

The input resistance of an operational amplifier is very high.  This means that very little current flows into the input terminals during operation.

If all of the transistors in the operational amplifier were identical then the output voltage would be zero if the two inputs were at equal voltages.  In practice this is not quite the case, and for sensitive work a {\bf trimming potentiometer} is connected.  This is adjusted until the op-amp is zeroed correctly.  

Simple operational amplifiers require the trimming potentiometer to be built into the circuit containing them, and an example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:invertamplifier}.  Other operational amplifier designs incorporate separate terminals for the trimming potentiometer.  These special terminals are labelled {\bf offset} on the manufacturer's diagram.  The exact method of connecting the potentiometer to the offset terminals can depend on the design of the operational amplifier, and you need to refer to the manufacturer's data sheet for details of which potentiometer to use and how to connect it.

For most commercially produced operational amplifiers (known as op-amps for short), the open loop gain $A$ is very large and does not stay constant.  Values of 100 000 are typical.  Usually a designer would want an amplifier with a stable gain of smaller value, and builds the operational amplifier into a circuit like the one in Figure~\ref{fig:invertamplifier}.

\Extension{Calculating the gain of the amplifier in Figure~\ref{fig:invertamplifier}.}{
\begin{enumerate}
\item The input resistance of the operational amplifier is very high.  This means that very little current flows into the inverting input of the op-amp.  Accordingly, the current through resistor $R_{1}$ must be almost the same as the current through resistor $R_{2}$.  This means that the ratio of the voltage across $R_{1}$ to the voltage across $R_{2}$ is the same as the ratio of the two resistances.
\item The open loop gain $A$ of the op-amp is very high.  Assuming that the output voltage is less than a few volts, this means that the two input terminals must be at very similar voltages.  We shall assume that they are at the same voltage.  
\item We want the output voltage to be zero if the input voltage is zero.  Assuming that the transistors within the op-amp are very similar, the output voltage will only be zero for zero input voltage if $V_{+}$ is very close to zero.  We shall assume that $V_{+}=0$ when the trimming potentiometer is correctly adjusted.
\item It follows from the last two statements that $V_{-} \approx 0$, and we shall assume that it is zero.
\item With these assumptions, the voltage across $R_{2}$ is the same as $V_{out}$, and the voltage across $R_{1}$ is the same as $V_{in}$.  Since both resistors carry the same current (as noted in point 1), we may say that the magnitude of $V_{out} / V_{in} = R_{2} / R_{1}$.  However, if $V_{in}$ is negative, then $V_{out}$ will be positive.  Therefore it is customary to write the gain of this circuit as $V_{out} / V_{in} = - R_{2} / R_{1}$.

%\end{syllabus}

The circuits and components we have discussed are very useful.  You can build a radio or television with them.  You can make a telephone.  Even if that was all there was to electronics, it would still be very useful.  However, the great breakthrough in the last fifty years or so has been in {\bf digital} electronics.  This is the subject which gave us the computer.  The computer has revolutionized the way business, engineering and science are done.  Small computers programmed to do a specific job (called microprocessors) are now used in almost every electronic machine from cars to washing machines.  Computers have also changed the way we communicate.  We used to have telegraph or telephone wires passing up and down a country --- each one carrying one telephone call or signal.  We now have optic fibres each capable of carrying tens of thousands of telephone calls using {\bf digital} signals.


So, what is a digital signal?  Look at Figure~\ref{fig:digitalanalogue}.  A normal signal, called an {\bf analogue} signal, carries a smooth wave.  At any time, the voltage of the signal could take any value.  It could be 2,00 V or 3,53 V or anything else.  A digital signal can only take certain voltages.  The simplest case is shown in the figure --- the voltage takes one of two values.  It is either {\bf high}, or it is {\bf low}.  It never has any other value.

These two special voltages are given symbols.  The low voltage level is written 0, while the high voltage level is written as 1.  When you send a digital signal, you set the voltage you want (0 or 1), then keep this fixed for a fixed amount of time (for example 0.01 $\mu$s), then you send the next 0 or 1.  The digital signal in Figure~\ref{fig:digitalanalogue} could be written 01100101.

Why are digital signals so good?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using a computer, any information can be turned into a pattern of 0s and 1s.  Pictures, recorded music, text and motion pictures can all be turned into a string of 0s and 1s and transmitted or stored in the same way.  The computer receiving the signal at the other end converts it back again.  A Compact Disc (CD) for example, can store music or text or pictures, and all can be read using a computer.
\item The 0 and the 1 look very different.  You can immediately tell if a 0 or a 1 is being sent.  Even if there is interference, you can still tell whether the sender sent a 0 or a 1.  This means that fewer mistakes are made when reading a digital signal.  This is why the best music recording technologies, and the most modern cameras, for example, all use digital technology.
\item Using the 0s and 1s you can count, and do all kinds of mathematics.  This will be explained in more detail in the next section.
\end{enumerate}

The simplest digital circuits are called {\bf logic gates}.  Each logic gate makes a decision based on the information it receives.  Different logic gates are set up to make the decisions in different ways.  Each logic gate will be made of many microscopic transistors connected together within a thin wafer of silicon.  This tiny circuit is called an Integrated Circuit or I.C. - all the parts are in one place (integrated) on the silicon wafer.  

\subsection{Logic Gates}
There are five main types of logic gate: NOT, AND, OR, NAND and NOR. Each one makes its decision in a different way.


\subsubsection{The NOT Gate}
{\bf Problem:} You want an automatic circuit in your office to turn on the heating in the winter.  You already have a digital electronic temperature sensor.  When the temperature is high, it sends out a 1.  When the office is cold, it sends out a 0.  If this signal were sent straight to the heater, the heater would turn on (1) when it was already hot, and would stay off when it was cold.  This is wrong!  To make the heater work, we need a circuit which will change a 0 (from the sensor) into a 1 (to send to the heater).  This will make the heater come on when it is cold. You also want it to change a 1 (from the sensor) into a 0 (to send to the heater).  This will turn the heater off when the room is hot.  This circuit is called an {\bf inverter} or {\bf NOT gate}.  It changes 0 into 1 (1 is NOT 0).  It changes 1 into 0 (0 is NOT 1).  It changes a signal into what it is NOT.

The symbol for the NOT gate is:

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(0,0)(2.2,1.7)
\psline(0.5,0)(0.5,1)(1.5,0.5)(0.5,0)
\pscircle(1.6,0.5){0.1}
\psline(0,0.5)(0.5,0.5)
\psline(1.7,0.5)(2.5,0.5)
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

The action of the NOT gate can be written in a table called a {\bf truth table}.  The left column shows the possible inputs on different rows.  The right column shows what the output (decision) of the circuit will be for that input.  The truth table for the NOT gate is shown below.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline
\textbf{Input} & \textbf{Output}\\\hline\hline
0&1\\\hline
1&0\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

When you read the truth table, the top row says, ``If the input is 0, the output will be 1.''  For our heater, this means, ``If the room is cold, the heater will turn on.''  The bottom row says, ``If the input is 1, the output will be 0.''  For our heater, this means, ``If the room is hot, the heater will switch off.''

\subsubsection{The AND Gate}
{\bf Problem:} An airliner has two toilets.  Passengers get annoyed if they get up from their seat only to find that both toilets are being used and they have to go back to their seat and wait.  You want to fit an automatic circuit to light up a display if both toilets are in use.  Then passengers know that if the light is off, there will be a free toilet for them to use.  There is a sensor in each toilet.  It gives out a 0 of the toilet is free, and a 1 if it is in use.  You want to send a 1 to the display unit if {\bf both} sensors are sending 1s.  To do this, you use an AND gate.

The symbol for the AND gate is:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(1.5,0)(4.5,2)
\psline(2.7,1.8)(2,1.8)(2,0.2)(2.7,0.2)
\psarc(2.7,1){0.8}{-90}{90}
\psline(1.5,0.5)(2,0.5)
\psline(1.5,1.5)(2,1.5)
\psline(3.5,1)(4.2,1)
\end{pspicture}
\caption{Symbol for the AND logic gate.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The truth table for the AND gate is shown below.  An AND gate has two inputs (the NOT gate only had one).  This means we need four rows in the truth table, one for each possible set of inputs.  The first row, for example, tells us what the AND gate will do if both inputs are 0.  In our airliner, this means that both toilets are free.  The right column has a 0 showing that the output will be 0, so the display will not light up.  The second row has inputs of 0 and 1 (the first toilet is free, the other is in use).  Again the output is 0.  The third row tells us what will happen if the inputs are 1 and 0 (the first toilet is in use, and the second is free).  Finally, the last line tells us what will happen if both inputs are 1 (the first toilet is in use and the second toilet is in use).  It is only in this case that the output is 1 and the display lights up.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\textbf{Inputs}} & \textbf{Output}\\\hline
A&B& \\\hline\hline
0&0&0\\\hline
0&1&0\\\hline
1&0&0\\\hline
1&1&1\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This device is called an AND gate, because the output is only 1 if one input AND the other input are both 1.

\Extension{Using 0 and 1 to mean True and False}{When we use logic gates we use the low voltage state 0 to represent `false'.  The high voltage state 1 represents `true'.  This is why the word AND is so appropriate.  A AND B is true (1) if, and only if, A is true (1) AND B is true (1).}

\Extension{AND and multiplication}{Sometimes, the AND operation is written as multiplication.  A AND B is written AB.  If either A or B are 0, then AB will also be 0.  For AB to be 1, we need A and B to both be 1.  Multiplication of the numbers 0 and 1 does exactly the same job as an AND gate.}

\subsubsection{The NAND Gate}
{\bf Problem:} You build the circuit for the airliner toilets using an AND gate.  Your customer is pleased, but she says that it would be better if the display lit up when there {\bf was} a free toilet.  In other words, the display should light up unless both toilets are in use.  To do this we want a circuit which does the opposite of an AND gate.  We want a circuit which would give the output 0 where an AND gate would give 1.  We want a circuit which would give the output 1 where an AND gate would give 0.  This circuit is called a NAND gate.

The symbol for the NAND gate is:

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(1.5,0)(4.5,2)
\psline(2.7,1.8)(2,1.8)(2,0.2)(2.7,0.2)
\psarc(2.7,1){0.8}{-90}{90}
\pscircle(3.6,1){0.1}
\psline(1.5,0.5)(2,0.5)
\psline(1.5,1.5)(2,1.5)
\psline(3.7,1)(4.2,1)
\end{pspicture}
%\caption{Symbol for the NAND logic gate.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The truth table for the NAND gate is shown below.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\textbf{Inputs}} & \textbf{Output}\\\hline
A&B& \\\hline\hline
0&0&1\\\hline
0&1&1\\\hline
1&0&1\\\hline
1&1&0\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

You may have noticed that we could have done this job on the airliner by using our earlier circuit, with a NOT gate added between the original AND gate and the display.  This is where the word NAND comes from --- it is short for NotAND.

\subsubsection{The OR Gate}
{\bf Problem:} A long, dark corridor has two light switches --- one at each end of the corridor.  The switches each send an output of 0 to the control unit if no-one has pressed the switch.  If someone presses the switch, its output is 1.  The lights in the corridor should come on if either switch is pressed. To do this job, the control unit needs an OR gate. The symbol for the OR gate is:

The truth table for the OR gate is shown.

\end{center}

You can see that the output is 1 (and the lights come on in the corridor) if either one switch OR the other is pressed.  Pressing both switches also turns on the lights, as the last row in the table shows.

\Extension{OR and addition}{Sometimes you will see A OR B written mathematically as A+B.  This makes sense, since if A=0 and B=0, then A OR B = A+B = 0.  Similarly, if A=0 and B=1, then A OR B = A+B = 1.  If A=1 and B=0, then A OR B = A+B = 1 once again.  The only case where the OR function differs from normal addition is when A=1 and B=1.  Here A OR B = 1 in logic, but A+B=2 in arithmetic.  However, there is no such thing as `2' in logic, so we define + to mean `OR', and write 1+1=1 with impunity!


If you wish, you can prove that the normal rules of algebra still work using this notation:  A+(B+C) = (A+B)+C, A(BC) = (AB)C, and A(B+C) = AB + AC.  This special kind of algebra where variables can only be 0 (representing false) or 1 (representing true) is called Boolean algebra.}

\subsubsection{The NOR Gate}
The last gate you need to know is the NOR gate.  This is opposite to the OR gate.  The output is 1 if both inputs are 0.  In other words, the output switches on if neither the first NOR the second input is 1.  The symbol for the NOR gate is:

The examples given were easy.  Each job only needed one logic gate.  However any `decision making' circuit can be built with logic gates, no matter how complicated the decision.  Here is an example.

\begin{wex}{An Economic Heating Control}{A sensor in a building detects whether a room is being used. If it is empty, the output is 0, if it is in use, the output is 1.  Another sensor measures the temperature of the room.  If it is cold, the output is 0.  If it is hot, the output is 1.  The heating comes on if it receives a 1.  Design a control circuit so that the heating only comes on if the room is in use and it is cold.}{The first sensor tells us whether the room is occupied.  The second sensor tells us whether the room is hot.  The heating must come on if the room is occupied AND cold.  This means that the heating should come on if the room is occupied AND (NOT hot).  To build the circuit, we first attach a NOT gate to the output of the temperature sensor.  This output of the NOT gate will be 1 only if the room is cold.  We then attach this output to an AND gate, together with the output from the other sensor. The output of the AND gate will only be 1 if the room is occupied AND the output of the NOT gate is also 1.  So the heating will only come on if the room is in use and is cold.  The circuit is shown below.

Next we prepare a truth table.  There is a column for each of the inputs, for the intermediate point C and also for the output.  The truth table has four rows, since there are four possible inputs --- 00, 01, 10 and 11.

Finally we see that this combination of gates does the same job as an OR gate.

Each logic gate is manufactured from two or more transistors.  Other circuits can be made using logic gates, as we shall see in the next section.  We shall show you how to count and store numbers using logic gates.  This means that if you have enough transistors, and you connect them correctly to make the right logic gates, you can make circuits which count and store numbers.

In practice, the cheapest gate to manufacture is usually the NAND gate. Additionally, Charles Peirce showed that NAND gates alone (as well as NOR gates alone) can be used to reproduce all the other logic gates.

%\end{syllabus}

In the previous section, we saw how the numbers 0 and 1 could represent `false' and `true' and could be used in decision making.  Often we want to program a computer to count with numbers.  To do this we need a way of writing any number using nothing other than 0 and 1.  When written in this way, numbers are called {\bf binary numbers}.

\Definition{Binary Number System}{A way of writing any number using only the digits 0 and 1.}

\subsection{Binary numbers}

In normal (denary) numbers, we write 9+1 as 10.  The fact that the `1' in 10 is the second digit from the right tells us that it actually means 10 and not 1.  Similarly, the `3' in 365 represents 300 because it is the third digit from the right.  You could write 365 as $3 \times 100 + 6 \times 10 + 5$.  You will notice the pattern that the $n$th digit from the right represents $10^{n-1}$.  In binary, we use the $n$th digit from the right to represent $2^{n-1}$.  Thus 2 is written as 10 in binary.  Similarly $2^{2} = 4$ is written as 100 in binary, and $2^{3} = 8$ is written as 1000 in binary.

\begin{wex}{Conversion of Binary Numbers to Denary Numbers}{Convert the binary number 10101 to its denary equivalent.}{We start on the right.  The `1' on the right does indeed represent one.  The next `1' is in the third place from the right, and represents $2^2 = 4$.  The next `1' is in the fifth place from the right and represents $2^4 = 16$.  Accordingly, the binary number 10101 represents 16+4+1 = 21 in denary notation.}
\end{wex}


\begin{wex}{Conversion of Denary Numbers to Binary Numbers}{Convert the decimal number 12 to its binary equivalent.}{Firstly we write 12 as a sum of powers of 2, so 12 = 8+4.  In binary, eight is 1000, and four is 100.  This means that twelve = eight + four must be 1000+100 = 1100 in binary.  You could also write 12 as $1 \times 8 + 1 \times 4 + 0 \times 2 + 0 \times 1 = 1100$ in binary.}
\end{wex}

\begin{IFact}{How do you write numbers as a sum of powers of two?  The first power of two (the largest) is the largest power of two which is not larger than the number you are working with.  In our last example, where we wanted to know what twelve was in binary, the largest power of two which is not larger than 12 is 8.  Thus 12 = 8 + something.  By arithmetic, the `something' must be 4, and the largest power of two not larger than this is 4 exactly.  Thus 12 = 8 + 4, and we have finished.

A more complicated example would be to write one hundred in binary.  The largest power of two not larger than 100 is 64 (1000000 in binary).  Subtracting 64 from 100 leaves 36.  The largest power of two not larger than 36 is 32 (100000 in binary).  Removing this leaves a remainder of 4, which is a power of two itself (100 in binary).  Thus one hundred is 64 + 32 + 4, or in binary  1000000 + 100000 + 100 = 1100100.} \end{IFact}

Once a number is written in binary, it can be represented using the low and high voltage levels of digital electronics.  We demonstrate how this is done by showing you how an electronic counter works.

\subsection{Counting circuits}

To make a counter you need several `T flip flops', sometimes called `divide by two' circuits.  A T flip flop is a digital circuit which swaps its output (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) whenever the input changes from 1 to 0.  When the input changes from 0 to 1 it doesn't change its output.  It is called a {\bf flip flop} because it changes (flips or flops) each time it receives a pulse.

If you put a series of pulses 10101010 into a T flip flop, the result is 01100110.  Figure~\ref{fig:Tinout} makes this clearer.

\label{fig:Tinout}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

As you can see from Figure~\ref{fig:Tinout}, there are half as many pulses in the output.  This is why it is called a `divide by two' circuit.

If we connect T flip flops in a chain, then we make a counter which can count pulses.  As an example, we connect three T flip flops in a chain.  This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Tchain}.

\caption{Three T flip flops connected together in a chain to make a counter.  The input of each flip flop is labelled T, while each output is labelled Q.

This is explained in the text and in the next table.}
\label{fig:Tchain}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

When this circuit is fed with a stream of pulses, the outputs of the different stages change.  The table below shows how this happens.  Each row shows a different stage, with the first stage at the top.  We assume that all of the flip flops have 0 as their output to start with.

\begin{center} \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|r|r|} \hline

1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 000 \\ \hline

0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 8 & 1000 \\ \hline
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 8 & 1000 \\ \hline
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 9 & 1101 \\ \hline
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 9 & 1101 \\ \hline \end{tabular} \end{center}
               
The binary numbers in the right hand column count the pulses arriving at the input.  You will notice that the output of the first flip flop gives the right most digit of the pulse count (in binary).  The output of the second flip flop gives the second digit from the right (the `twos' digit) of the pulse count.  The output of the third flip flop gives the third digit from the right (the `fours' digit) of the pulse count.  As there are only three flip flops, there is nothing to provide the next digit (the `eights' digit), and so the eighth pulse is recorded as 000, not 1000.

This device is called a {\bf modulo 8} counter because it can count in eight stages from 000 to 111 before it goes back to 000.  If you put four flip flops in the counter, it will count in sixteen stages from 0000 to 1111, and it is called a modulo 16 counter because it counts in sixteen stages before going back to 0000.

\Definition{Modulo}{The modulo of a counter tells you how many stages (or pulses) it receives before going back to 0 as its output.  Thus a modulo 8 counter counts in eight stages 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111, then returns to 000 again.}

\begin{IFact}{If a counter contains $n$ flip flops, it will be a modulo $2^{n}$ counter.  It will count from 0 to $2^{n} - 1$.}\end{IFact}

\subsection{Storing binary numbers}

Counting is important.  However, it is equally important to be able to remember the numbers.  Computers can convert almost anything to a string of 0s and 1s, and therefore to a binary number.  Unless this number can be stored in the computer's memory, the computer would be useless.

The memory in the computer contains many parts.  Each part is able to store a single 0 or 1.  Since 0 and 1 are the two binary digits, we say that each part of the memory stores one {\bf bit}.

\Definition{Bit}{One bit is a short way of saying one `binary digit'.  It is a single 0 or 1.}

\begin{IFact}{If you have eight bits, you can store a binary number from 00000000 to 11111111 (0 to 255 in denary).  This gives you enough permutations of 0s and 1s to have one for each letter of the alphabet (in upper and lower case), each digit from 0 to 9, each punctuation mark and each control code used by a computer in storing a document.  When you type text into a word processor, each character is stored as a set of eight bits.  Each set of eight bits is called a {\bf byte}.  Computer memories are graded according to how many bytes they store.  There are 1024 bytes in a kilobyte (kB), $1024 \times 1024$ bytes in a megabyte (MB), and $1024 \times 1024 \times 1024$ bytes in a gigabyte (GB).} \end{IFact}

To store a bit we need a circuit which can `remember' a 0 or a 1.  This is called a {\bf bistable} circuit because it has two stable states.  It can stay indefinitely either as a 0 or a 1.  An example of a bistable circuit is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bistable}.  It is made from two NOR gates.

Once you have used the S or R inputs to set or reset the bistable circuit, you then bring both inputs back to 0.  The bistable `remembers' the state.  Because of the ease with which the circuit can be Reset and Set it is also called an {\bf RS flip flop} circuit.

Computer memory can store millions or billions of bits.  If it used our circuit above, it would need millions or billions of NOR gates, each of which is made from several transistors.  Computer memory is made of many millions of transistors.

\begin{IFact}{The bistable circuits drawn here don't remember 0s or 1s forever --- they lose the information if the power is turned off.  The same is true for the RAM (Random Access Memory) used to store working and temporary data in a computer.  Some modern circuits contain special memory which can remember its state even if the power is turned off.  This is used in FLASH drives, commonly found in USB data sticks and on the memory cards used with digital cameras.  These bistable circuits are much more complex.}  \end{IFact}

You can also make T flip flops out of logic gates, however these are more complicated to design.

\chapter[EM Radiation]{Electromagnetic Radiation}
\label{p:em:emr12}

\section{Introduction}
This chapter will focus on the electromagnetic (EM) radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is a self-propagating wave in space with electric and magnetic components. These components oscillate at right angles to each other and to the direction of propagation, and are in phase with each other. Electromagnetic radiation is classified into types according to the frequency of the wave: these types include, in order of increasing frequency, radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.

\section{Particle/wave nature of electromagnetic radiation}
\label{p:em:emr12:d}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item Explain that some aspects of the behaviour of EM radiation can best be explained using a wave model and some aspects can best be explained using a particle model
%\item Note: Link to Grade 12 Matter and Materials, photoelectric effect
%\end{syllabus}

If you watch a colony of ants walking up the wall, they look like a thin continuous black line.  But as you look closer, you see that the line is made up of thousands of separated black ants.

Light and all other types of electromagnetic radiation seems like a continuous wave at first, but when one performs experiments with light, one can notice that light can have both wave and particle like properties.  Just like the individual ants, the light can also be made up of individual bundles of energy, or quanta of light.

Light has both wave-like and particle-like properties (wave--particle duality), but only shows one or the other, depending on the kind of experiment we perform. A wave-type experiment shows the wave nature, and a particle-type experiment shows particle nature.  One cannot test the wave and the particle nature at the same time. A particle of light is called a photon.

\Definition{Photon}{A photon is a quantum (energy packet) of light.}

The particle nature of light can be demonstrated by the interaction of photons with matter.  One way in which light interacts with matter is via the photoelectric effect, which will be studied in detail in Chapter~\ref{p:mm:op12}.

\Exercise{Particle/wave nature of electromagnetic radiation}{
\begin{enumerate}
\item Give examples of the behaviour of EM radiation which can best be explained using a wave model.
\item Give examples of the behaviour of EM radiation which can best be explained using a particle model.

\section{The wave nature of electromagnetic radiation}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item as mutual induction of oscillating magnetic/electric fields
%\item Describe the source of electromagnetic waves as an accelerating charge
%\item Use words and diagrams to explain how an EM wave propagates when an electric field oscillating in one plane produces a magnetic field oscillating in a plane at right angles to it, which produces an oscillating electric field, and so on  
%\item State that these mutually regenerating fields travel through space at a constant speed of 3x108m/s, represented by c.
%\item Note: Mention that unlike sound waves, EM waves do not need a medium to travel through
%\end{syllabus}

Accelerating charges emit electromagnetic waves. We have seen that a changing electric field generates a magnetic field and a changing magnetic field generates an electric field. This is the principle behind the propagation of electromagnetic waves, because electromagnetic waves, unlike sound waves, do not need a medium to travel through. EM waves propagate when an electric field oscillating in one plane produces a magnetic field oscillating in a plane at right angles to it, which produces an oscillating electric field, and so on. The propagation of electromagnetic waves can be described as \textit{mutual induction}. 

These mutually regenerating fields travel through empty space at a constant speed of $3 \times 10^8\ems$, represented by $c$.

\label{p:em:emr12:ems}

%\begin{syllabus}

%\item The learner Given the wavelength of EM waves, must be able to calculate the frequency and vice versa, using the equation c=f.lambda.

Observe the things around you, your friend sitting next to you, a large tree across the field. How is it that you are able to see these things? What is it that is leaving your friend's arm and entering your eye so that you can see his arm? It is light. The light originally comes from the sun, or possibly a light bulb or burning fire. In physics, light is given the more technical term electromagnetic radiation, which includes all forms of light, not just the form which you can see with your eyes. 

Electromagnetic radiation allows us to observe the world around us. It is this radiation which reflects off of the objects around you and into your eye. The radiation your eye is sensitive to is only a small fraction of the total radiation emitted in the physical universe. All of the different fractions taped together make up the electromagnetic spectrum. 

\Extension{Dispersion}{When white light is split into its component colours by a prism, you are looking at a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.}

The wavelength of a particular electromagnetic radiation will depend on how it was created. 

\Exercise{Wave Nature of EM Radiation}{
\begin{enumerate}
\item List one source of electromagnetic waves. Hint: consider the spectrum diagram and look at the names we give to different wavelengths.
\item Explain how an EM wave propagates, with the aid of a diagram.
\item What is the speed of light? What symbol is used to refer to the speed of light? Does the speed of light change?
\item Do EM waves need a medium to travel through? 
\end{enumerate}
}

The radiation can take on any wavelength, which means that the spectrum is continuous. Physicists broke down this continuous band into sections. Each section is defined by how the radiation is created, not the wavelength of the radiation. But each category is continuous within the min and max wavelength of that category, meaning there are no wavelengths excluded within some range. 

The spectrum is in order of wavelength, with the shortest wavelength at one end and the longest wavelength at the other. The spectrum is then broken down into categories as detailed in Table~\ref{tab:emspectrum}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\caption{Electromagnetic spectrum}
\label{tab:emspectrum}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
\textbf{Category}&\textbf{Range of Wavelengths (nm)}&\textbf{Range of Frequencies (Hz)}\\\hline\hline
gamma rays&$<$1&$>3\times 10^{19}$ \\\hline
X-rays&1-10&$3\times 10^{17}$-$3\times 10^{19}$\\\hline
ultraviolet light&10-400&$7,5\times 10^{14}$-$3\times 10^{17}$\\\hline
visible light&400-700&$4,3\times 10^{14}$-$7,5\times 10^{14}$\\\hline
infrared&700-$10^{5}$&$3\times 10^{12}$-$4,3\times 10^{19}$\\\hline
microwave&$10^{5}-10^{8}$&$3\times 10^{9}$-$3\times 10^{12}$\\\hline
radio waves&$>10^{8}$&$<3\times 10^{9}$\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}


Since an electromagnetic wave is still a wave, the following equation that you learnt in Grade 10 still applies:
\nequ{c=f\cdot \lambda}


\begin{wex}{EM spectrum I}{Calculate the frequency of red light with a wavelength of $4,2 \times 10^{-7}$~m}{ 
We use the formula: $c=f\lambda$ to calculate frequency. The speed of light is a constant $3 \times 10^{8}$m/s.
\begin{eqnarray*}
c&=&f\lambda\\
3 \times 10^{8}&=&f \times 4,2 \times 10^{-7} \\
f &=& 7,14 \times 10^{14} \rm {Hz}
\end{eqnarray*}}
\end{wex}

\begin{wex}{EM spectrum II}
{Ultraviolet radiation has a wavelength of $200~\mathrm{nm}$. What is the frequency of the radiation?}
{\westep{To calculate the frequency we need to identify the
wavelength and the velocity of the radiation.}
Recall that all radiation travels at the speed of light ($c$) in vacuum.
Since the question does not specify through what type of material the Ultraviolet radiation
is traveling, one can assume that it is traveling through a vacuum.
We can identify two properties of the radiation - $wavelength
~(200~\mathrm{nm})$ and speed ($c$).
%From previous chapters, we know that the period of the wave
%is the time it takes
%for a wave to complete one cycle or one wavelength. 

\westep{We can use the equation $c = f \lambda$ to find the frequency since the wavelength is given.}
\begin{eqnarray*}
c &=& f \lambda \\
3 \times 10^{8} &=& f \times 200 \times 10^{-9} \\
f &=&  1.5 \times 10^{15} \ \rm{Hz}
\end{eqnarray*}
}
\end{wex}



Examples of some uses of electromagnetic waves are shown in Table~\ref{tab:emuses}. 

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\caption{Uses of EM waves}
\label{tab:emuses}
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{5cm}|}\hline
\textbf{Category}&\textbf{Uses}\\\hline\hline
gamma rays&used to kill the bacteria in marshmallows and to sterilise medical equipment\\\hline
X-rays&used to image bone structures\\\hline
ultraviolet light&bees can see into the ultraviolet because flowers stand out more clearly at this frequency\\\hline

infrared&night vision, heat sensors, laser metal cutting\\\hline
microwave&microwave ovens, radar\\\hline
radio waves&radio, television broadcasts\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

In theory the spectrum is infinite, although realistically we can only observe wavelengths from a few hundred kilometers to those of gamma rays due to experimental limitations. 

Humans experience electromagnetic waves differently depending on their wavelength. Our eyes are sensitive to visible light while our skin is sensitive to infrared, and many wavelengths we do not detect at all.

\section{The particle nature of electromagnetic radiation}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item energy of a photon related to frequency and wavelength
%\item Calculate the energy of a photon using E = hf = hc/lambda
%\end{syllabus}

When we talk of electromagnetic radiation as a particle, we refer to photons, which are packets of energy. The energy of the photon is related to the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation according to:
%\equ{E=h\cdot f= \frac{hc}{\lambda}}{eq:ehf}
$h$ (called Planck's constant).






\Definition{Planck's constant}{Planck's constant is a physical constant named after Max Planck.

\nequ{h =6,626 \times 10^{-34}\ \mbox{J}\cdot\mbox{s}}
}

The energy of a photon can be calculated using the formula: $E=hf$ or $E=h \frac{c}{\lambda}$.
Where E is the energy of the photon in joules (J), h is planck's constant, c is the speed of light, f is the frequency in hertz (Hz) and $\lambda$ is the wavelength in metres (m).

\begin{wex}{Calculating the energy of a photon I}{Calculate the energy of a photon with a frequency of $3 \times 10^{18}$~Hz}

We use the formula: $E=hf$

\begin{eqnarray*}

\westep{Solve the problem}
\begin{eqnarray*}
E & = & h\frac{c}{\lambda}\\

\subsection {Exercise - particle nature of EM waves}
\begin{enumerate}
\item How is the energy of a photon related to its frequency and wavelength?
\item Calculate the energy of a photon of EM radiation with a frequency of $10^{12}$~Hz.
\item Determine the energy of a photon of EM radiation with a wavelength of 600 nm.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Penetrating ability of electromagnetic radiation}
\label{p:em:emr12:pa}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item Indicate the penetrating ability of the different kinds of EM radiation and relate it to energy of the radiation.
%\item Describe the dangers of gamma rays, X-rays and the damaging effect of ultra-violet radiation on skin
%\item Note: Link to Grade 11 Matter and Materials, atomic nuclei
%\end{syllabus}

Different kinds of electromagnetic radiation have different penetrabilities. For example, if we take the human body as the object. Infrared light is emitted by the human body. Visible light is reflected off the surface of the human body, ultra-violet light (from sunlight) damages the skin, but X-rays are able to penetrate the skin and bone and allow for pictures of the inside of the human body to be taken.

If we compare the energy of visible light to the energy of X-rays, we find that X-rays have a much higher energy. Usually, kinds of electromagnetic radiation with higher energy have higher penetrabilities than those with low energies.

Certain kinds of electromagnetic radiation such as ultra-violet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays are very dangerous. Radiation such as these are called ionising radiation. Ionising radiation transfers energy as it passes through matter, breaking molecular bonds and creating ions.
 
Excessive exposure to radiation, including sunlight, X-rays and all nuclear radiation, can cause destruction of biological tissue. 

\subsection{Ultraviolet(UV) radiation and the skin}
UVA and UVB are different ranges of frequencies for ultraviolet (UV) light. UVA and UVB can damage collagen fibres which results in the speeding up skin aging. In general, UVA is the least harmful, but it  can contribute to the aging of skin, DNA damage and possibly skin cancer. It penetrates deeply and does not cause sunburn. Because it does not cause reddening of the skin (erythema) it cannot be measured in the SPF testing. There is no good clinical measurement of the blocking of UVA radiation, but it is important that sunscreen block both UVA and UVB.

UVB light can cause skin cancer. The radiation excites DNA molecules in skin cells, resulting in possible mutations, which can cause cancer. This cancer connection is one reason for concern about ozone depletion and the ozone hole.

As a defense against UV radiation, the body tans when exposed to moderate (depending on skin type) levels of radiation by releasing the brown pigment melanin. This helps to block UV penetration and prevent damage to the vulnerable skin tissues deeper down. Suntan lotion, often referred to as sunblock or sunscreen, partly blocks UV and is widely available. Most of these products contain an SPF rating that describes the amount of protection given. This protection, however, applies only to UVB rays responsible for sunburn and not to UVA rays that penetrate more deeply into the skin and may also be responsible for causing cancer and wrinkles. Some sunscreen lotion now includes compounds such as titanium dioxide which helps protect against UVA rays. Other UVA blocking compounds found in sunscreen include zinc oxide and avobenzone.

\Extension{What makes a good sunscreen?}{
\begin{itemize}
\item UVB protection: Padimate O, Homosalate, Octisalate (octyl salicylate), Octinoxate (octyl methoxycinnamate)
\item UVA protection: Avobenzone
\item UVA/UVB protection: Octocrylene, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, Mexoryl (ecamsule)
\end{itemize}

Another means to block UV is by wearing sun protective clothing. This is clothing that has a UPF rating that describes the protection given against both UVA and UVB.}

\subsection{Ultraviolet radiation and the eyes}
High intensities of UVB light are hazardous to the eyes, and exposure can cause welder's flash (photo keratitis or arc eye) and may lead to cataracts, pterygium and pinguecula formation.

Protective eyewear is beneficial to those who are working with or those who might be exposed to ultraviolet radiation, particularly short wave UV. Given that light may reach the eye from the sides, full coverage eye protection is usually warranted if there is an increased risk of exposure, as in high altitude mountaineering. Mountaineers are exposed to higher than ordinary levels of UV radiation, both because there is less atmospheric filtering and because of reflection from snow and ice.

Ordinary, untreated eyeglasses give some protection. Most plastic lenses give more protection than glass lenses. Some plastic lens materials, such as polycarbonate, block most UV. There are protective treatments available for eyeglass lenses that need it which will give better protection. But even a treatment that completely blocks UV will not protect the eye from light that arrives around the lens. To convince yourself of the potential dangers of stray UV light, cover your lenses with something opaque, like aluminum foil, stand next to a bright light, and consider how much light you see, despite the complete blockage of the lenses. Most contact lenses help to protect the retina by absorbing UV radiation.

\subsection{X-rays}
While x-rays are used significantly in medicine, prolonged exposure to X-rays can lead to cell damage and cancer.

For example, a mammogram is an x-ray of the human breast to detect breast cancer, but if a woman starts having regular mammograms when she is too young, her chances of getting breast cancer increases.

\subsection{Gamma-rays}
Due to the high energy of gamma-rays, they are able to cause serious damage when absorbed by living cells.

Gamma-rays are not stopped by the skin and can induce DNA alteration by interfering with the genetic material of the cell. DNA double-strand breaks are generally accepted to be the most biologically significant lesion by which ionising radiation causes cancer and hereditary disease.

A study done on Russian nuclear workers exposed to external whole-body gamma-radiation at high cumulative doses shows a link between radiation exposure and death from leukaemia, lung, liver, skeletal and other solid cancers.


\Extension{Cellphones and electromagnetic radiation}{Cellphone radiation and health concerns have been raised, especially following the enormous increase in the use of wireless mobile telephony throughout the world. This is because mobile phones use electromagnetic waves in the microwave range. These concerns have induced a large body of research. Concerns about effects on health have also been raised regarding other digital wireless systems, such as data communication networks.
In 2009 the World Health Organisation announced that they have found a link between brain cancer and cellphones.

Cellphone users are recommended to minimise radiation, by for example:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use hands-free to decrease the radiation to the head.
\item Keep the mobile phone away from the body.
\item Do not telephone in a car without an external antenna.
\end{enumerate}

}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Indicate the penetrating ability of the different kinds of EM radiation and relate it to energy of the radiation.
\item Describe the dangers of gamma rays, X-rays and the damaging effect of ultra-violet radiation on skin

\section {Introduction}
For centuries physicists argued about whether light was a particle or a wave. It was assumed that light could only be one or the other, but not both.
 
%In earlier chapters on waves (Chapters~\ref{p:wsl:tw10}, \ref{p:wsl:de12}, \ref{p:wsl:c12}, \ref{p:wsl:2d3d12}) and optics (Chapters~\ref{p:wsl:go10} and \ref{p:wsl:go11}), you studied how light or other electromagnetic radiation propagates like a wave. The wave nature of light was demonstrated by the propagation of light in examples such as diffraction, interference, and polarisation of light.

In earlier chapters on waves and optics, you studied how light or other electromagnetic radiation propagates like a wave. The wave nature of light was demonstrated by the propagation of light in examples such as diffraction, interference, and polarisation of light.

 
You also saw in Electromagnetic Radiation how light sometimes behaves as a particle. This chapter looks at evidence supporting the \textit{particle model of light}. The idea that light can have both wave and particle properties was one of the most important discoveries of the twentieth century.

\subsection{Energy levels of an electron}
We have seen that the electrons in an atom have different energy levels. When the electron receives enough energy, it can jump up to a higher energy level. This is called \textit{'exciting'} the electron. When the electron in a high energy level sheds some energy, it drops to a lower energy level. 
 
We have also seen that the energy associated with light at a specific wavelength is given by:
\nequ{E=\frac{h c}{\lambda}.}\\
 
In the particle model of light, this means that each packet of light (photon) at a wavelength $\lambda$ has energy:
\nequ{E=\frac{h c}{\lambda}.}

For the electron to receive energy, it \textit{absorbs} a photon and gets its energy. When an electron loses energy to drop to a lower level, it \textit{emits} (gives off) a photon with that energy. 

\subsection{Interaction of light with metals}
When light encounters or passes through a material, the photons of the light interact with the atoms or molecules of the material.  Depending on the strength of the interactions and how often they happen, the light will pass through the material or be scattered in some other direction.
 
Each wavelength of light relates to a particular energy, and the closer that energy is to the energy difference between two of the levels of the atom, the likelier the photon is to interact with the atom.
 
When visible or ultraviolet (UV) radiation shines on a metal, the photons are \textit{absorbed} by the electrons in the metal. The electrons are then excited up to a higher energy level. When an electron returns to a lower energy level, another photon is emitted. This is how light appears to be \textbf{reflected} off a metal surface. 
 
In previous chapters, you have studied geometrical optics, which tells us what happens to rays of light when they are reflected off a surface or refracted through a lens.  That tells us what happens to light rays, made up of many photons, on a large scale.  If you look at a smaller level, i.e. on a microscopic scale, then reflection and refraction happen by all the photons interacting with the atoms of the lens or mirror.  The photons get absorbed and re-emitted many times before emerging as the finals rays of light that we see.
 
%The dependence of the scattering of light on the energy levels of the materials it encounters is responsible for many effects that we see in %everyday life.  
Scattering of light is responsible for many effects in everyday life.
We see that certain materials are red or blue, for example, since they contain materials that have energy level differences that correspond to the energies of the photons that make up red or blue light.  These materials then reflect the red or blue light and absorb the other wavelengths in the visible spectrum.  White objects reflect photons of all wavelengths in the visual spectrum, while black objects absorb these photons.

\begin{IFact}{Because a truly black object absorbs all the visual wavelengths of light, and does not re-emit photons at visual wavelengths, we can say that 'black' is not a colour itself, but rather a \textit{lack of} colour! Also, since black objects absorb visual light, they heat up more than objects of other colours which reflect light at certain wavelengths.}
\end{IFact}

\Activity{Investigation}{Reflection and absorption}
{
\Aim{Investigate the interaction of light with differently coloured metal objects}
\Apparatus{Find some differently coloured metal objects (at least 5) which will not be damaged if left in the sun for 15 minutes. Make sure to include at least one white item and one black item.}
\Method{At the start of your lesson set out your objects in direct sunlight. Leave them there for around 15 minutes.

Alternatively, if it is a sunny day, you can use your teachers' cars for this experiment - as long as there are some cars of different colours and they have been standing in direct sunlight for the same length of time! } 

After 15 minutes is up, touch each of the items/cars (be careful not to burn yourself!) and compare their temperatures (rate them from 1 to 5 with 1 being cold and 5 being very hot) in a table such as the example table below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c |}
\hline
\textbf{Object} & \textbf{Colour} & \textbf{Temperature rating} \\ \hline \hline
e.g. car 1 & e.g. red & e.g. 3 \\ \hline
   &      &    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Questions:}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Which object was the hottest and what was it made of?
\item Which object was the coolest and what was it made of?
\item How did the temperatures of the black and white objects compare to each other? (which one was hotter and which was cooler?)
\item Try to explain the reasons for the different temperatures of the objects with respect to their colours and the materials of which they are made. 
\end{enumerate}
}
 
Metals generally reflect most wavelengths of visible light, but they will reflect the light in a certain direction, given by the laws of reflection in geometrical optics.  This is different to most materials, like wood or fabric, which reflect light in all directions.  Metals have this property since they have electrons that are not bound to atoms and can move freely through the metal. This is unlike most other materials that have their electrons bound closely to the atoms.  These free electrons in metals can then absorb and reflect photons of a wide range of energies. 

\textit{Ultraviolet light} (which has shorter wavelengths than visible light) will pass through some substances, such as many plastics, because they do not have the right energy levels to absorb it and re-emit it. \textit{X-rays} (also short wavelengths) will also pass through most materials, since the energies of X-rays correspond to the energy levels of atomic nuclei.  Such nuclei are much smaller than atoms, so it is much less likely for an X-ray to hit a nucleus instead of the whole atom.

Most materials will absorb \textit{infrared radiation} (longer wavelengths than visible light), since the energies of that radiation often correspond to rotational or vibrational energy levels of molecules.

\subsection{Why is the sky blue?}
The sun emits light at many different wavelengths, including all of the visible wavelengths. Light which is made up of all the visible wavelengths appears white. So what causes the sky to look blue?

The atmosphere consists of molecules of different gases as well as tiny dust grains. Light from the sun scatters off the molecules in the air (called \textbf{Rayleigh scattering}).  
The chance that the light will scatter off the gas molecules is \textit{higher} for \textit{shorter} wavelengths.  The \textit{short wavelength} \textbf{blue light} is therefore scattered more than the other colours.  At noon, when the light from the sun is coming straight down (see the picture), the scattered blue light reaches your eyes from all directions and so the sky appears blue. The other wavelengths do not get scattered much and therefore miss your line of sight and are not seen. At sunrise or sunset, the direction of the light coming from the sun is now straight towards your eyes (see the picture). Therefore the scattered blue light can't be seen because it is scattered out of your line of sight. The redder colours (oranges and reds) can now be seen because they are not scattered as much and still fall in your line of sight.

\section{The photoelectric effect}

Around the turn of the twentieth century, it was observed by a number of physicists (including Hertz, Thomson and Von Lenard) that when light was shone on a metal, electrons were emitted by the metal. This is called the photoelectric effect. (\textit{photo}- for light, \textit{electric}- for the electron.)

\Definition{The photoelectric effect}{The photoelectric effect is the process whereby an electron is emitted by a metal when light shines on it.}


At that time, light was thought to be purely a wave. Therefore, physicists thought that if a more intense (i.e. brighter) light was shone on a metal, then the electrons would be knocked out with greater kinetic energies than if a faint light was shone on them. However, Von Lenard observed that this did not happen at all. The \textit{intensity} of the light made \textit{no difference} to the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons! Also, it was observed that the electrons were emitted immediately when light was shone on the metal - there was no time delay.

Einstein solved this problem by proposing that light is made up of packets of energy called \textit{quanta} (now called photons) which interacted with the electrons in the metal like particles instead of waves. Each incident photon would transfer all its energy to one electron in the metal. For a specific colour of light (i.e. a certain wavelength or frequency), the energy of the photons is given by $E = hf = hc/\lambda$, where $h$ is Planck's constant. The energy needed to knock an electron out of the metal is called the \textbf{work function} (symbol $\phi$) of the metal. Therefore, the amount of energy left over as the kinetic energy ($E_{k}$) of the emitted electron would be the difference between the incoming photon's energy and the energy needed to knock out the electron (work function of the metal): 

\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{k} &=& hf - \phi 
\end{eqnarray*} 

Increasing the intensity of the light (i.e. making it brighter) did not change the wavelength of the light and therefore the electrons would be emitted with \textit{the same} kinetic energy as before! This solved the paradox and showed that light has \textit{both} a \textbf{wave nature} and a \textbf{particle nature}. Einstein won the Nobel prize for this quantum theory and his explanation of the photoelectric effect. 

Increasing the intensity of the light actually means increasing the \textit{number} of incident photons. Therefore, since each photon only gives energy to one electron, more incident photons means \textit{more} electrons would be knocked out of the metal, but their kinetic energies would be \textit{the same} as before.

\begin{IFact}
{The photoelectric effect was first observed in the experiments of Heinrich Hertz in 1887. In 1899 J.J. Thomson proved that it was electrons that were emitted. The photoelectric effect was theoretically explained by Albert Einstein in 1905.}

The discovery and understanding of the photoelectric effect was one of the major breakthroughs in science in the twentieth century as it provided concrete evidence of the particle nature of light. It overturned previously held views that light was composed purely of a continuous transverse wave. On the one hand, the wave nature is a good description of phenomena such as diffraction and interference for light, and on the other hand, the photoelectric effect demonstrates the particle nature of light. This is now known as the `dual-nature' of light. (dual means two)

%The new picture considered light (or in general, electromagnetic radiation) to be composed of several 'packets' or 'quanta' (plural for %'quantum') of energy. Each individual photon had a fixed amount of energy depending on the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation.
%However, the wave nature of electromagnetic radiation was also valid since phenomena such as diffraction and interference could only be %explained using the wave nature as they are basic wave properties. Hence a general agreement was reached that light (all electromagnetic %radiations) exhibits a dual nature. Light behave as waves in some cases and behaves as particles in other cases. This came to be known as the %'dual-nature of light'. This  dual-nature of light and all other electromagnetic radiations forms the backbone of quantum mechanics . Note that %the energy of quanta is quantised ($E = hf$) which means that the energy can have a value only in multiples of $h$ (Planck's constant). 
 
While solving problems we need to decide for ourselves whether we should consider the wave property or the particle property of light. For example, when dealing with interference and diffraction, light should be treated as a wave, whereas when dealing with photoelectric effect we consider the particle nature.

%\label{elec_cir}
%\end{center}
%\end{figure}

We have learnt that a metal contains electrons that are free to move between the valence and conduction bands. When a photon strikes the surface of a metal, it gives \textit{all} its energy to one electron in the metal. 
\begin{itemize}
\item If the photon energy is \textit{equal} to the energy between two energy levels then the electron is excited to the higher energy level.
\item If the photon energy is \textit{greater} than or \textit{equal to} the work function (energy needed to escape from the metal), then the electron is emitted from the surface of the metal (the photoelectric effect). 
\end{itemize}

The work function is different for different elements. The smaller the work function, the easier it is for electrons to be emitted from the metal. Metals with low work functions make good conductors. This is because the electrons are attached less strongly to their surroundings and can move more easily through these materials. This reduces the resistance of the material to the flow of current i.e. it conducts well. Table~\ref{tab:work_fun} shows the work functions for a range of elements.

%Since, $E=hf$, we can calculate a minimum frequency $f_{min}$ of electromagnetic radiation that will cause an electron to be emitted from the %metal, where

{The \textbf{electron volt} (eV) is the kinetic energy gained by an electron  passing through a potential difference of one volt (1 $\mathrm{V}$). A \textbf{volt} is not a measure of energy, but the \textbf{electron volt} is a unit of energy. When you connect a $1.5 ~\mathrm{V}$ battery to a circuit, you can give $1.5~\mathrm{eV}$ of energy to every electron.}

%Suppose an electron in the metal needs $5~\mathrm{eV}$ of energy to escape the surface of the metal ($5~\mathrm{eV}$ is the binding energy of %the electron).

But suppose the photon has instead not $2~\mathrm{eV}$, but rather $8~\mathrm{eV}$ of energy. This %means that the electron will emerge from the metal, and it will also have some kinetic energy. The maximum kinetic energy that it can have is %$3~\mathrm{eV}$ when it leaves the surface.
% This does not mean the photon can give $5~\mathrm{eV}$ of energy to one electron and $3~\mathrm{eV}$ to another. A photon will give all of its %energy to just one electron.

%The minimum amount of energy needed for an electron to escape from a particular metal $E_{min}$, is called the work function of the metal. We %denote the work function of the metal by the Greek letter $\mathrm{\phi}$ ($\mathrm{phi}$). In our example, the work function is %$5~\mathrm{eV}$. The work function has a different value for each material: for example $4,70~\mathrm{eV}$ for copper and $2,28~\mathrm{eV}$ for %sodium. It is worth mentioning that the best conductors are those with the smallest work functions. This is why the photoelectric effect is most %easily measured by shining photons onto a metal.

%The kinetic energy of the electron $E_k$ is directly proportional to the frequency of the radiation, and is independent of the intensity of the %light. For incoming radiation of a given frequency, the number of electrons emitted per unit time is proportional to the intensity of the %radiation. This can be shown in Fig~\ref{int_light_diff}.  The greater the intensity of the light shining on the metal, the greater the number %of electrons emitted, and hence the greater the current that is measured.
% Another important feature of the photoelectric effect, is that the electron emission takes place from the instant the light shines on the %surface, i.e. there is no detectable time delay.  This finding was unexpected. Classical theory predicted that the electrons would pick up %energy over a period of time, like the heating effect, and then be emitted. The photoelectric effect, since the electrons were emitted %instantaneously, could therefore not be explained by classical theories.  It could only be explained by assuming that each photon behaved like a %particle of light, giving all its energy instantaneously to one electron.  
%We have shown that light can act as a wave with a characteristic wavelength and frequency. This was also studied in the previous chapters on %waves \ref{chap:pw} and optics \ref{chap:optics}.  In this chapter we have studied that light can also acts as a bunch of discrete particles %each with a bundle of energy related to the frequency.

\begin{wex}{The photoelectric effect - I}
{Ultraviolet radiation with a wavelength of 250~nm is incident on a silver foil (work function $\phi$ = $6,9 \times 10^{-19}$). What is the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons?}
{\westep{Determine what is required and how to approach the problem}
We need to determine the maximum kinetic energy of an electron ejected from a silver foil by ultraviolet radiation. 

The photoelectric effect tells us that:
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{k} & = & E_{photon} - \phi \\
E_k & = & h\frac{c}{\lambda}-\phi
\end{eqnarray*}

We also have: \\
Work function of silver: $\phi =6,9 \times 10^{-19}$ J  \\
UV radiation wavelength = 250~nm = $250 \times 10^{-9}$ m \\
Planck's constant: $h = 6,63 \times 10^{-34}~~\rm{m^{2}}\rm{kg}\rm{s^{-1}}$ \\
speed of light: $c = 3 \times 10^{8}~\rm{m}\rm{s^{-1}}$ \\

\westep{Solve the problem}
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{k} & = & \frac{hc}{\lambda} - \phi \\
& = & [6,63 \times 10^{-34} \times \frac{3\times10^{8}}{250\times10^{-9}}] - 6,9 \times 10^{-19} \\
& = & 1,06 \times 10^{-19}~\rm{J}
\end{eqnarray*}

The maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electron will be $1,06 \times 10^{-19}~\rm{J}$.}
\end{wex}



\begin{wex}{The photoelectric effect - II}
{If we were to shine the same ultraviolet radiation ($f = 1,2 \times 10^{15}~\rm{Hz}$), on a gold foil (work function $= 8,2 \times 10^{-19}~\mathrm{J}$), would any electrons be emitted from the surface of the gold foil?}
{
For the electrons to be emitted from the surface, the energy of each photon needs to be \textit{greater} than the work function of the material. 
\westep{Calculate the energy of the incident photons}
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{photon}& = & hf \\
& = & 6,63 \times 10^{-34} \times 1,2 \times 10^{15} \\
& = & 7,96 \times 10^{-19}~\rm{J}\\
\end{eqnarray*}

Therefore each photon of ultraviolet light has an energy of $7,96 \times 10^{-19}~\rm{J}$.

\westep{Write down the work function for gold.}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\phi_{gold} & = & 8,2 \times 10^{-19}~\mathrm{J} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Is the energy of the photons greater or smaller than the work function?}

\begin{eqnarray*}
7,96 \times 10^{-19}~\rm{J} & < & 8,2 \times 10^{-19}~\mathrm{J}  \\
E_{photons} & < & \phi_{gold} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

The energy of each photon is less than the work function of gold, therefore, the photons do not have enough energy to knock electrons out of the gold. No electrons would be emitted from the gold foil.}
\end{wex}


\Extension{Units of energy}{
When dealing with calculations at a small scale (like at the level of electrons) it is more convenient to use different units for energy rather than the joule (J). We define a unit called the electron-volt (eV) as the kinetic energy gained by an electron passing through a potential difference of one volt. 
\nequ{E = q \times V}
where $q$ is the charge of the electron and $V$ is the potential difference applied. The charge of 1 electron is $1,6 \times 10^{-19}$~C, so 1~eV is calculated to be:
\nequ{1\;\mathrm{eV}= (1,6  10^{-19}\;\mathrm{C} \times 1\;\mathrm{V}) =1,6 \times 10^{-19}\eJ}

\noindent You can see that  $1,6 \times 10^{-19}$ J is a very small amount of energy and so using electron-volts (eV) at this level is easier.

\noindent Hence, 1eV = $1.6 \times 10^-19$ J which means that 1 J = $6.241 \times 10^{18}$ eV

%\subsection{Relation to De Broglie's hypothesis}
%The dual-nature of light has an intricate relation with De Broglie's hypothesis. Recall that the wavelength of matter waves is given by:
%$\lambda= h/p$
%where	$\lambda$ is the wavelength of the matter wavelength, $h$ is Planck's constant and $p$ is the momentum of the body.
%De Broglie's equation gives us the wavelength of any object that has velocity (and thus momentum). Conversely, it also leads us to the idea of %electromagnetic waves possessing momentum (by just writing the equation as $p=\frac{h}{\lambda}$, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the %wave). This led to the idea of waves having mass, which is totally misleading. Photons do possess momentum according to several experiments, but %the existence of mass has never been established. We will assume that photons possess momentum (and not worry about whether they have mass or %not!).
 
%\begin{IFact}
%{The fact that waves have momentum has been put to some very innovative practical use. You might have heard of solar sails; several space %agencies are thinking of using them in the propulsion of space vehicles. This would use the change in momentum of light photons from the Sun %which are deflected back after striking the reflective surface of the sail. The force due to this change in momentum could be used to provide %thrust for the spacecraft.}

\subsection{Real-life applications}
\subsubsection{Solar Cells}
The photo-electric effect may seem like a very easy way to produce electricity from the sun.
This is why people choose to make solar panels out of materials like silicon, to generate electricity. 
In real-life however, the amount of electricity generated is less than expected. This is because not every photon knocks out an electron. Other  processes such as reflection or scattering also happen. This means that only a fraction $\approx 10\%$ (depends on the material) of the photons produce photoelectrons. This drop in efficiency results in a lower current. Much work is being done in industry to improve this efficiency so that the panels can generate as high a current as possible, and create as much electricity as possible from the sun. But even these smaller electrical currents are useful in applications like solar-powered calculators.

\section{Emission and absorption spectra}

\subsection{Emission Spectra}

You have learnt previously about the structure of an atom.  The electrons surrounding the atomic nucleus are arranged in a series of levels of increasing energy.  Each element has its own distinct set of energy levels.  This arrangement of energy levels serves as the atom's unique fingerprint.
 
In the early 1900s, scientists found that a liquid or solid heated to high temperatures would give off a broad range of colours of light. However, a gas heated to similar temperatures would emit light only at certain specific colours (wavelengths).  The reason for this observation was not understood at the time.\\  
 
Scientists studied this effect using a discharge tube.  

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.in]{../discharge_tube.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Diagram of a discharge tube.  The tube is filled with a gas.  When a high enough voltage is applied across the tube, the gas ionises and acts like a conductor, allowing a current to flow through the circuit.  The current excites the atoms of the ionised gas.  When the atoms fall back to their ground state, they emit photons to carry off the excess energy.}
\label{dischargetube}
\end{figure}


A discharge tube (Figure~\ref{dischargetube}) is a glass gas-filled tube with a metal plate at both ends. If a large enough voltage difference is applied between the two metal plates, the gas atoms inside the tube will absorb enough energy to make some of their electrons come off i.e. the gas atoms are ionised. These electrons start moving through the gas and create a current, which raises some electrons in other atoms to higher energy levels. Then as the electrons in the atoms fall back down, they emit electromagnetic radiation (light). The amount of light emitted at different wavelengths, called the \textbf{emission spectrum}, is shown for a discharge tube filled with hydrogen gas in figure~\ref{hydrogenspectrum} below. Only certain wavelengths (i.e. colours) of light are seen as shown by the thick black lines in the picture.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{../hydrogen_emission_spectrum.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Diagram of the emission spectrum of hydrogen in the visible spectrum.  Four lines are visible, and are labeled with their wavelengths.  The three lines in the 400--500 nm range are in the blue part of the spectrum, while the higher line (656 nm) is in the red/orange part.}
\label{hydrogenspectrum}
\end{figure}

Eventually, scientists realized that these lines come from photons of a specific energy, emitted by electrons making transitions between specific energy levels of the atom.  Figure~\ref{ig:Henergy} shows an example of this happening.  When an electron in an atom falls from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, it emits a photon to carry off the extra energy.  This photon's energy is equal to the energy difference between the two energy levels.  As we previously discussed, the frequency of a photon is related to its energy through the equation $E=hf$.  Since a specific photon frequency (or wavelength) gives us a specific colour, we can see how each coloured line is associated with a specific transition. 
 
%\begin{figure}[H]
%\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{../hydrogen_transitions.eps}
%\caption{In this diagram, various energy levels of the hydrogen atom are shown, with the associated transitions between these levels.  Each %transition gives off a photon with a distinct energy.  Each set of transitions lies in a different area of the electromagnetic spectrum.  For %example, the transitions to the ground state give off ultraviolet radiation; the transitions down to the first excited state (second energy %level) give off visible light; the transitions to the second excited state give off ultraviolet radiation.}

Visible light is not the only kind of electromagnetic radiation emitted. More energetic or less energetic transitions can produce ultraviolet or infrared radiation. However, because each atom has its own distinct set of energy levels (its fingerprint!), each atom has its own distinct emission spectrum.



 
\subsection{Absorption spectra}

As you know, atoms do not only emit photons; they also absorb photons. If a photon hits an atom and the energy of the photon is the same as the gap between two electron energy levels in the atom, then the electron can absorb the photon and jump up to the higher energy level. If the atom has no energy level differences that equal the incoming photon's energy, it cannot absorb the photon, and can only scatter it.
 
Using this effect, if we have a source of photons of various energies we can obtain the \textbf{absorption spectra} for different materials. To get an absorption spectrum, just shine white light on a sample of the material that you are interested in. White light is made up of all the different wavelengths of visible light put together. In the absorption spectrum, the energy levels corresponding to the absorbed photons show up as black lines because the photons of these wavelengths have been absorbed and don't show up. Because of this, the absorption spectrum is the exact \textit{inverse} of the emission spectrum. Look at the two figures below. In figure~\ref{fig:emissionSpec} you can see the emission lines of hyrodrogen. Figure~\ref{fig:absorptionSpec} shows the absorption spectrum. It is the exact opposite of the emission spectrum! Both emission and absorption techniques can be used to get the same information about the energy levels of an atom.

\begin{wex}{Absorption}
{I have an unknown gas in a glass container. I shine a bright white light through one side of the container and measure the spectrum of transmitted light. I notice that there is a black line (\textit{absorption} line) in the middle of the visible red band at 642 nm. I have a hunch that the gas might be hydrogen. If I am correct, between which 2 energy levels does this transition occur? (Hint: look at figure~\ref{fig:Henergy} and the transitions which are in the visible part of the spectrum.)
}
{\westep{What is given and what needs to be done?}
We have an absorption line at 642 nm. This means that the substance in the glass container absorbed photons with a wavelength of 642 nm. 
We need to calculate which 2 energy levels of hydrogen this transition would correspond to. Therefore we need to know what energy the absorbed photons had.

\westep{Calculate the energy of the absorbed photons}
\begin{eqnarray*}
E &=& \frac{hc}{\lambda} \\
  &=& \frac{(6,63 \times 10^{-34}) \times (3\times10^{8})}{642\times10^{-9}}\\
  &=& 3,1 \times 10^{-19}~~\rm{J}
\end{eqnarray*}
The absorbed photons had energy of $3,1 \times 10^{-19}$

\westep{Find the energy of the transitions resulting in radiation at visible wavelengths}
Figure~\ref{fig:Henergy} shows various energy level transitions. The transitions related to visible wavelengths are marked as the transitions beginning or ending on Energy Level 2. 
Let's find the energy of those transitions and compare with the energy of the absorbed photons we've just calculated.

Energy of transition (absorption) from Energy Level 2 to Energy Level 3:
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{2,3} &=& E_{2} - E_{3}\\
&=& 16,3 \times 10^{-19}~~\rm{J} - 19,4 \times 10^{-19}~~\rm{J}\\
&=& -3,1 \times 10^{-19}~~\rm{J}
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore the energy of the photon that an electron must absorb to jump from Energy Level 2 to Energy Level 3 is $3,1 \times 10^{-19}~~\rm{J}$.
(NOTE: The minus sign means that \textit{absorption} is occurring.)

This is the same energy as the photons which were absorbed by the gas in the container! Therefore, since the transitions of all elements are unique, we can say that the gas in the container is hydrogen. The transition is absorption of a photon between Energy Level 2 and Energy Level 3.

\subsection{Colours and energies of electromagnetic radiation}
We saw in the explanation for why the sky is blue that different \textit{wavelengths} or \textit{frequencies} of light correspond to different \textit{colours} of light. The table below gives the wavelengths and colours of light in the visible spectrum:

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | c |}
\hline
\textbf{Colour} & \textbf{Wavelength range (nm)} \\ \hline \hline
 violet   & 390 - 455  \\ \hline
 blue   &   455 -  492       \\ \hline
 green  &   492 - 577        \\ \hline
 yellow  &  577 - 597       \\ \hline
 orange  &  597 - 622        \\ \hline
 red  &    622 - 780         \\ \hline
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Colours and wavelengths of light in the visible spectrum.}
\label{t:Optic:Colours}
\end{table}

We also know that the energy of a photon of light can be found from:
\begin{eqnarray*}
E & = &hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda} 
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore if we know the frequency or wavelength of light, we can calculate the photon's energy and vice versa. 

\Activity{Investigation}{Frequency, wavelength and energy relation}
{
\noindent Refer to table~\ref{t:Optic:Colours}: Copy the table into your workbook and add two additional columns.
\begin{enumerate}
\item In the first new column write down the lower and upper frequencies for each colour of light. 
\item In the second column write down the energy range (in Joules) for each colour of light.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Questions}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Which colour of visible light has the highest energy photons?
\item Which colour of visible light has the lowest energy photons?
\end{enumerate} 
}




\begin{wex}{Colours of light}
{A photon of wavelength 500 nm is emitted by a traffic light. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the energy of the photon?
\item What is the frequency of the photon?
\item Use table~\ref{t:Optic:Colours} to determine the colour of the light.
\end{enumerate}
}
{
\westep{What information is given and what do we need to find?}
We are given $\lambda = 500 \times 10^{-9}~~\rm{m}$ and we need to find the photon's \textit{energy}, \textit{frequency} and \textit{colour}.

\westep{Use the equation $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$ to find the photon's energy}
\begin{eqnarray*}
E & = & \frac{hc}{\lambda} \\
& = & \frac{(6,63 \times 10^{-34}) \times (3 \times 10^{8})}{ 500 \times 10^{-9}} \\
& = & 3,98 \times 10^{-19}~~\rm{J}
\end{eqnarray*}
The energy of the photon is $3,98\times10^{-19}$ J.

\westep{We know the energy of the photon, now we can use $E=hf$ to solve for the frequency}
\begin{eqnarray*}
E & = & hf \\
f & = & \frac{E}{h} \\
  & = & \frac{3.98 \times 10^{-19}}{6,63 \times 10^{-34}}\\
  & = & 6 \times 10^{14}~~\rm{Hz}
\end{eqnarray*}
The frequency of the photon is $6 \times 10^{14}~~\rm{Hz}$.

\westep{Use the table to find the colour of light}
The wavelength given in the question is 500 nm. We can see in the table that green light has wavelengths between 492 - 577 nm. Therefore 500 nm is in this range so the colour of the light is \textbf{green}.

}
\end{wex}

\begin{wex}{Colours and energies of light}
{I have some sources which emit light of the following wavelengths:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item 400 nm, 
\item 580 nm, 
\item 650 nm,
\item 300 nm.
\end{enumerate}
What are the colours of light emitted by the sources (see table~\ref{t:Optic:Colours})? Which source emits photons with the highest energy and which with the lowest energy?
}
{
\westep{What information is given, and what do we need to do?}
Four wavelengths of light are given and we need to find their \textit{colours}. 

We also need to find which colour photon has the highest energy and which one has the lowest energy.

\westep{To find the colours of light, we can compare the wavelengths to those given in table~\ref{t:Optic:Colours}}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item 400 nm falls into the range for \textit{violet} light (390 - 455 nm).
 \item 580 nm falls into the range for \textit{yellow} light (577 - 597 nm).
 \item 650 nm falls into the range for \textit{red} light (622 - 780 nm).
 \item 300 nm is not shown in the table. However, this wavelength is just a little shorter than the shortest wavelength in the violet range. Therefore 300 nm is \textit{ultraviolet}.
\end{enumerate}

\westep{To find the colour of the light whose photons have the highest and lowest energies respectively, we need to calculate the energies of all the photons}

We know $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$

\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
For 400 nm:
\begin{eqnarray*}
E & = & \frac{hc}{\lambda} \\
  & = & \frac{(6,63 \times 10^{-34}) \times (3 \times 10^{8}) }{400 \times 10^{-9}} \\
  & = &  4,97 \times 10^{-19}~~\rm{J}
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
For 580 nm:
\begin{eqnarray*}
E & = & \frac{hc}{\lambda} \\
  & = & \frac{(6,63 \times 10^{-34}) \times (3 \times 10^{8}) }{580 \times 10^{-9}} \\
  & = &  3,43 \times 10^{-19}~~\rm{J}
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
For 650 nm:
\begin{eqnarray*}
E & = & \frac{hc}{\lambda} \\
  & = & \frac{(6,63 \times 10^{-34}) \times (3 \times 10^{8}) }{650 \times 10^{-9}} \\
  & = &  3,06 \times 10^{-19}~~\rm{J}
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
For 300 nm:
\begin{eqnarray*}
E & = & \frac{hc}{\lambda} \\
  & = & \frac{(6,63 \times 10^{-34}) \times (3 \times 10^{8}) }{300 \times 10^{-9}} \\
  & = &  6,63 \times 10^{-19}~~\rm{J}
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{minipage}

Therefore, the photons with the highest energy are the \textbf{ultraviolet} photons. \\
The photons with the lowest energy are from light which is \textbf{red}.

\subsection{Applications of emission and absorption spectra}
The study of spectra from stars and galaxies in astronomy is called \textit{spectroscopy}. Spectroscopy is a tool widely used in astronomy to learn different things about astronomical objects.

\subsubsection{Identifying elements in astronomical objects using their spectra}
Measuring the spectrum of light from a star can tell astronomers what the star is made of! Since each element emits or absorbs light only at particular wavelengths, astronomers can identify what elements are in the stars from the lines in their spectra. From studying the spectra of many stars we know that there are many different types of stars which contain different elements and in different amounts.

%\textit{Nebulae} are enormous clouds of gas and dust in our galaxy which are thought to be the birth places of stars. Astronomers have been able %to deduce that most of the gas in these clouds is hydrogen gas (ionised) by identifying the emission lines in the spectra of these objects.

\subsubsection{Determining velocities of galaxies using spectroscopy}
You have already learned in Chapter~\ref{p:wsl:de12} about the Doppler effect and how the frequency (and wavelength) of sound waves changes depending on whether the object emitting the sound is moving \textit{towards} or \textit{away} from you. The same thing happens to electromagnetic radiation (light). If the object emitting the light is moving \textit{towards} us, then the wavelength of the light appears shorter (called \textbf{blue-shifted}). If the object is moving \textit{away} from us, then the wavelength of its light appears stretched out (called \textbf{red-shifted}). 

The Doppler effect affects the spectra of objects in space depending on their motion relative to us on the earth. For example, the light from a distant galaxy, which is moving away from us at some velocity, will appear red-shifted. This means that the emission and absorption lines in the galaxy's spectrum will be shifted to a longer wavelength (lower frequency). Knowing where each line in the spectrum would normally be if the galaxy was not moving, and comparing to their red-shifted positions, allows astronomers to precisely measure the velocity of the galaxy relative to the earth!



\subsubsection{Global warming and greenhouse gases}
The sun emits radiation (light) over a range of wavelengths which are mainly in the visible part of the spectrum. Radiation at these wavelengths passes through the gases of the atmosphere to warm the land and the oceans below. The warm earth then radiates this heat at longer infrared wavelengths. Carbon-dioxide (one of the main greenhouse gases) in the atmosphere has energy levels which correspond to the infrared wavelengths which allow it to absorb the infrared radiation. It then also emits at infrared wavelengths in all directions. This effect stops a large amount of the infrared radiation getting out of the atmosphere, which causes the atmosphere and the earth to heat up. More radiation is coming in than is getting back out.

Therefore increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increases the amount of trapped infrared radiation and therefore the overall temperature of the earth. The earth is a very sensitive and complicated system upon which life depends and changing the delicate balances of temperature and atmospheric gas content may have disastrous consequences if we are not careful.

{\noindent In pairs try to find the following information (e.g. in books, on the internet) and report back to the class in a 5 minute presentation which includes the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What other gases besides carbon dioxide are responsible for the greenhouse effect?
\item Where do greenhouse gases come from? (are they human-made or natural?)

A laser is a device that produces a special type of light: all the laser photons are identical! They all have the \textit{same} wavelength (and frequency), amplitude and phase. Since they all have the same wavelength, this means they all have the same \textit{colour} and the light is called \textbf{monochromatic}. (\textit{Note:} \textit{mono} means "one" or "single" and \textit{chromatic} means "colour".) This is very different to most other light sources which produce light with a range of wavelengths (e.g. white light from the sun consists of all the visible wavelengths.)
 
Laser light is highly directional and can be focused very well. This focus allows laser beams to be used over long distances, and to pack a lot of energy into the beam while still requiring reasonably small amounts of energy to be generated. Each centimetre of a typical laser beam contains many billions of photons. 
These special properties of laser light come from the way in which the laser photons are created and the energy levels of the material that makes up the laser. These properties make laser light extremely useful in many applications from CD players to eye surgery.\\
 
The term \textbf{LASER} stands for \textbf{L}ight \textbf{A}mplification by the \textbf{S}timulated \textbf{E}mission of \textbf{R}adiation. This \textbf{stimulated emission} is different to the \textbf{spontaneous emission} already discussed earlier. Let's review the absorption and emission processes which can occur in atoms.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Absorption}: As you can see in the picture above, \textbf{absorption} happens when an electron jumps up to a higher energy level by \textit{absorbing} a photon which has an energy equal to the energy difference between the two energy levels. 

\item \textbf{Spontaneous emission}: \textbf{Spontaneous emission} is when an electron in a higher energy level drops down to a lower energy level and a photon is emitted with an energy equal to the energy difference between the two levels. There is no interference in this process from outside factors. Usually spontaneous emission happens very quickly after an electron gets into an excited state. In other words, the lifetime of the excited state is very short (the electron only stays in the high energy level for a very short time). However, there are some excited states where an electron can remain in the higher energy level for a longer time than usual before dropping down to a lower level. These excited states are called \textbf{metastable states.}

\item \textbf{Stimulated emission}: As the picture above shows, \textbf{stimulated emission} happens when a photon with an energy equal to the energy difference between two levels interacts with an electron in the higher level. This \textit{stimulates} the electron to emit an identical photon and drop down to the lower energy level. This process results in two photons at the end.

\end{itemize}

\Definition{Spontaneous Emission}{Spontaneous emission occurs when an atom is in an unstable excited state and randomly decays to a less energetic state, emitting a photon to carry off the excess energy.  The unstable state decays in a characteristic time, called the lifetime.}

\Definition{Meta-stable state}{A meta-stable state is an excited atomic state that has an unusually long lifetime, compared to the lifetimes of other excited states of that atom. While most excited states have lifetimes measured in microseconds and nanoseconds ($10^{-6}$ s and $10^{-9}$ s), meta-stable states can have lifetimes of milliseconds ($10^{-3}$ s) or even seconds.}

\Definition{Stimulated emission}{Stimulated emission occurs when a photon interacts with an excited atom,  causing the atom to decay and emit another identical photon.}


\subsection{How a laser works}
A laser works by a process called \textit{stimulated emission} - as you can tell from what `laser' stands for! 
You can imagine that stimulated emission can lead to more and more identical photons being released in the following way: Imagine we have an electron in an excited metastable state and it drops down to the ground state by emitting a photon. If this photon then travels through the material and meets another electron in the metastable excited state this will cause the electron to drop down to the lower energy level and another photon to be emitted. Now there are two photons of the same energy. If these photons then both move through the material and \textit{each} interacts with another electron in a metastable state, this will result in them \textit{each} causing an additional photon to be released. i.e. from 2 photons we then get 4, and so on! This is how laser light is produced.

\caption{Spontaneous emission is a two step process, as shown here.  First, energy from an external source is applied to an atom in the laser medium, raising its energy to an excited (metastable) state.  After some time, it will decay back down to its ground state and emit the excess energy in the form of a photon.  This is the first stage in the formation of a laser beam. }

\end{center}
\caption{Stimulated emission is also a two step process, as shown here.  First, a laser photon encounters an atom that has been raised to an excited state, just like in the case of spontaneous emission.  The photon then causes the atom to decay to its ground state and emit another photon identical to the incoming photon.  This is the second step in the creation of a laser beam.  It happens many, many times as the laser photons pass through the optical cavity until the laser beam builds up to full strength.}
\label{laseramp}
\end{figure}


This can only happen if there are many electrons in a metastable state. If most of the electrons are in the ground state, then they will just \textit{absorb} the photons and no extra photons will be emitted. However, if more electrons are in the excited metastable state than in the ground state, then the process of stimulated emission will be able to continue. Usually in atoms, most of the electrons are in the lower energy levels and only a few are in excited states. When most of the electrons are in the excited metastable state and only a few are in the ground state, this is called \textbf{population inversion} (the populations in the excited and ground states are \textit{swapped} around) and this is when stimulated emission can occur. To start off the process, the electrons first have to be excited up into the metastable state. This is done using an external energy source.


\Definition{Population inversion}{Population inversion is when more atoms are in an excited state than in their ground state. It is a necessary condition to sustain a laser beam, so that there are enough excited atoms that can be stimulated to emit more photons.}

Therefore, materials used to make laser light \textit{must} must have metastable states which can allow population inversion to occur when an external energy source is applied. Some substances which are used to make lasers are listed in table~\ref{lasertypes}. You can see that gases (such as Helium-Neon mixture), liquids (such as dyes), and solids (such as the precious stone ruby) are all used to make lasers.

{The first working laser, using synthetic ruby as the laser material, was made by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories in Malibu, California.

Javan received the Albert Einstein Award in 1993.}

\subsection{A simple laser}


A laser consists of a number of different parts that work together to create the laser beam.  Figure~\ref{lasercavity} shows the different parts of the laser, while Figure~\ref{laserprocess} shows how they create the laser beam.\\

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.8in]{../laser-cavity_2.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Diagram of a laser showing the main components.}
\label{lasercavity}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[!tb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{../laser-process.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Diagram of a laser showing the process of creating a laser beam. (1) A source of external energy is applied to the laser medium, raising the atoms to an excited state. (2) An excited atom decays though spontaneous emission, emitting a photon.  (3) The photon encounters another excited atom and causes it to decay through stimulated emission, creating another photon. (4) The photons bounce back and forth through the laser medium between the mirrors, building up more and more photons.  (5) A small percentage of the photons pass through the partially-silvered mirror to become the laser beam we see.}
\label{laserprocess}
\end{figure}
 
The basis of the laser is the laser material which consists of the atoms that are used to create the laser beam. Many different materials can be used as laser material, and their energy levels determine the characteristics of the laser. Some examples of different lasers are shown in Table~\ref{lasertypes}. The laser material is contained in the optical cavity.\\ 
 
Before the laser is turned on, all the atoms in the laser material are in their ground state. The first step in creating a laser beam is to add energy to the laser material to raise most of the electrons into an excited metastable state. This is called \textit{pumping} the laser. \\ 

The creation of the laser beam starts through the process of \textit{spontaneous emission}, shown in Figure~\ref{laserse}. An electron drops down to the ground state and emits a photon with energy equal to the energy difference of the two energy levels. This laser photon is the beginning of the laser beam.\\

At some time a laser photon will run into another excited electron. Then stimulated emission occurs and the electron drops down to the ground state and emits an additional identical photon as shown in Figure~\ref{laseramp}. Since the laser material typically has a large number of atoms, one laser photon passing through this material will rapidly cause a large number of photons just like it to be emitted.\\
 
The optical cavity keeps the laser photons inside the laser cavity so that they can build up the laser beam. At each end is a concave mirror; one is a full mirror and one is a partial mirror. The full mirror is totally reflective. The partial mirror transmits a small amount of the light that hits it (less than 1\%). The mirrors are carefully aligned so that photons that reflect off one mirror become ``trapped'', and bounce back and forth between the mirrors many times causing more and more stimulated emission. The photons that eventually escape through the partially-silvered mirror become the laser beam that we see.\\
 
As the photons bounce between mirrors, they continually pass through the laser material, stimulating those atoms to emit more photons.  This creates an ever increasing beam of photons, all with the same characteristics, all traveling in the same direction.  In this way, the optical cavity helps to amplify the original laser photons into a concentrated, intense beam of photons.\\

The laser cavity also helps to narrow the frequency range of laser light emitted. The distance between the two mirrors defines the cavity \textit{mode} which only allows light of a narrow range of frequencies to continue being reflected back and forth. Light of other frequencies damped out. (This is just like in the chapter on the physics of music where a pipe of a certain length corresponds to a particular wavelength of sound.) Therefore only a narrow frequency of light can be emitted.


\begin{IFact}
{In 1953, Charles H. Townes and graduate students James P. Gordon and Herbert J. Zeiger produced the first maser, a device operating on similar principles to the laser, but producing microwave rather than optical radiation. Townes's maser was incapable of making a continuous beam. Nikolay Basov and Aleksandr Prokhorov of the former Soviet Union worked independently and developed a method of making a continuous beam using more than two energy levels. Townes, Basov and Prokhorov shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964.}
\end{IFact}


\subsection{Laser applications and safety}
Although the first working laser was only produced in 1958, lasers are now found in many household items. For example, lasers are well-known through their use as cheap laser pointers. However, lasers can be very dangerous to the human eye since a large amount of energy is focused into a very narrow beam. \textbf{NEVER POINT A LASER POINTER INTO SOMEBODY'S EYES - IT CAN BLIND THEM FOREVER.}

Other uses include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Semiconductor lasers which are small, efficient and cheap to make are used in CD players. 
\item He-Ne Lasers are used in most grocery shops to read in the price of items using their barcodes. This makes the cashiers' job much quicker and easier.
\item High energy lasers are used in medicine as a cutting and welding tool. Eye surgery in particular make use of the precision of lasers to reattach the retinas of patients' eyes. The heat from cutting lasers also helps to stop the bleeding of a wound by burning the edges (called cauterising).

\essay[Energy and electricity. Why the fuss?]

\essayauthor[Asogan Moodaly]

\essayauthorblurb[Asogan Moodaly received his Bachelor of Science
degree (with honours) in Mechanical Engineering from the University
of Natal, Durban in South Africa. For his final year design project
he worked on a 3-axis filament winding machine for composite (Glass
re-enforced plastic in this case) piping. He worked in Vereeniging,
Gauteng at Mine Support Products (a subsidiary of Dorbyl Heavy
Engineering) as the design engineer once he graduated. He currently
lives in the Vaal Triangle area and is working for Sasol Technology
Engineering as a mechanical engineer, ensuring the safety and
integrity of equipment installed during projects.]

Disclaimer: The details furnished below are very basic and for
illustration purposes only.

Why do we need energy? Note that I use the word 'energy' and not
'electricity'. On a broad scale it stimulates economic growth, etc,
etc but on a personal level it allows us to lead a comfortable
lifestyle.

e.g. Flick a switch and… 
\begin{itemize}
\item Heat for cooking 
\item Entertainment such as television and radio 
\item Heat for water and interior of house 
\item Ironing
\item Electronic and electrical devices such as alarms, garage doors, etc.
\end{itemize}

In a modern household this energy is provided in the form of electricity which is powered via fossil fuels or nuclear.

How is electricity made? In a nutshell: By moving a magnet through or near a set of conducting coils.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../1ElectricityGeneration.eps}
\end{figure}

Most power stations produce steam through heat (nuclear reaction or burning fossil fuels), the steam drives a turbine which moves a magnet relative to a coil (the generator - like the above but on a much larger scale i.e. bigger magnets, bigger coils, etc), which produces electricity that is transmitted via a power network to our homes. Gas fired plants burn gas directly in a gas turbine to produce the same desired relative motion between permanent magnet and coil.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../2SteamPower.eps}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../3PowerStation.eps}
\end{figure}

Coal, oil and gas are fossil fuels. Fossil fuels were created by
decomposing organic (plant and animal) matter a long, long time ago
and are typically found underground. Different temperatures and
pressures resulted in the organic matter transforming into coal, oil
or gas.

Why the fuss about fossil fuels?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fossil fuel power is bad news in
the long run. It pollutes and contributes to the greenhouse effect
(global warming resulting in melting polar ice caps, floods,
droughts, disease, etc).
\item It's not going to last forever.
\item Nuclear power is 'cleaner' in terms of emissions but there's no proven way
of disposing of the nuclear waste. Oh, and it won't last forever
either!
\end{enumerate}

Renewable Energy As the name suggests renewable energy lasts
'forever'. Solar (sun), wind, geothermal, wave, hydro and biomass
(organic) are all sources of energy that will last until the sun
eventually explodes many millions of years from now. Hopefully the
human race will have moved from the earth by then! Generally the
principal of renewable electricity generation is similar to fossil
fuel electricity generation in that electricity is generated by
moving a magnet relative to a conducting coil. What is different is
the way energy is supplied to cause that motion.

The below are a few different types of available renewable energy
technologies.

\subsection*{Solar}

There are different types of solar electricity technologies, the
main ones being solar thermal and photovoltaic.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../4solar1.eps}
\end{figure}

Solar thermal uses the heat of the sun to produce electricity. Sun
is concentrated using mirrors. This heat either creates steam which
drives a turbine which in turn drives a generator (as per fossil
fuel generation), or drives an air engine (engine that uses
expanding air to obtain motion) that drives a generator.

Photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly into electricity. The
benefit of photovoltaic panels is that there are no moving parts,
and is therefore relatively maintenance free. The downside is that
it's very expensive at this stage (17/06/2004).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../4solar2.eps}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Wind}

Wind turbines catch wind that spins the blades. The blades are
connected to a shaft that spins because of the wind. This spinning
shaft spins another shaft that turns a permanent magnet relative to
conducting coils.

Note that 'gears' are used to convert the slow spinning of the 1st
shaft to a faster spin on the 2nd shaft. The generator shaft needs
to spin at the correct speed to produce the right amount and quality
of electricity. Some generators are now being modified to run at
slower speeds. This saves money as gears are not needed.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../5Windturbine.eps}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Biomass}

Biomass is anything organic i.e. plant or animal matter. It can be
used in the place of coal as per a normal coal fired plant and is
renewable as long as the biomass e.g. wood; is handled in a
sustainable manner. By sustainable I mean that suitable farming
practices are used so that the land is not 'over farmed' which will
result in the soil becoming barren and nothing growing there again.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../6biogas.eps}
\end{figure}

Biomass can also be processed using 'anaerobic digestion' to produce a gas that can be burned for heat or electricity. This 'biogas' is made up of a number of other gases that are similar to those found in fossil fuel natural gas - Except the amount of the gases are different. E.g. Natural gas has about 94% methane and biogas has about 60% methane. (Methane is a gas that can be burnt for heat or power)

Anaerobic digestion: 'Anaerobic' means 'No air'. Therefore
'anaerobic digestion' means to digest in the absence of air.
Bacteria that naturally exist in organic matter will convert organic
matter to biogas and fertilizer when all the air is removed.

Thousands of anaerobic digesters have been installed in rural India,
Nepal and China in rural area's where cow dung, human waste and
chicken litter (faeces) are all processed using anaerobic digestion
to produce gas that can be burned in the home for cooking and
heating. The leftover is used as fertilizer.

\subsection*{Geothermal Energy}

In some places on earth, the earth's crust is thinner than others.
As a result the heat from the earth's core escapes. The heat can be
captured by converting water to steam, and using the steam to drive
a steam generator as discussed above.

Hydroelectric power Water from a river is diverted to turn a water
turbine to create electricity similar to the principles of steam
generation. The water is returned to the river after driving the
turbine.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../7hydroelectricriver.eps}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Wave Energy}

Some wave energy generators work similarly to
wind turbines except that underwater ocean currents turns the blades
instead of wind; and of course most of the structure is under water!
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../8hydroelectricocean1.eps}
\end{figure}

Another concept uses the rising and falling of the tides to suck air
in using a 'one way valve'. As a result air becomes compressed in a
chamber and the compressed air is let out to drive a turbine which
in turn drives a generator

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../8hydroelectricocean2.eps}
\end{figure}

These are relatively new technologies.

Liquid Fuels Liquid fuels are used mainly for transportation. Petrol
and diesel are the most common liquid fuels and are obtained from
oil.

Sasol is the only company in the world that makes liquid fuels from
coal; and will be one of the leading companies in the world to make
liquid fuels from natural gas! The Sasol petro-chemical plants are
based in Sasolburg on the border of the Free State and in Secunda in
Mpumalanga.

However, as discussed above coal, gas and oil are fossil fuels and
are not renewable. Petrol and diesel are obtained from fossil fuels
and therefore pollute and contribute to the green house effect
(global warming).

\subsection*{Alternatives}

\subsubsection*{Biodiesel} Oil can be extracted from plants such as the
soya bean, sunflower and rapeseed by pressing it through a filter.
This oil if mixed correctly with either methanol or dry ethanol and
Sodium Hydroxide will separate the plant oil into biodiesel,
glycerol and fertilizer.

The biodiesel can be used as produced in a conventional diesel
engine with little or no modifications required.

The glycerol can be refined a bit further for pharmaceutical
companies to use, or can be used to make soap.

\subsubsection*{Ethanol}

Corn, maize and sugar cane can be used to make ethanol as a fuel
substitute for petrol. It's made by the same fermentation process
used to make alcohol. Enzymes are often used to speed up the
process.

In ethanol from sugar cane production, the leftover 'bagasse' (the
fibre part of the sugar cane) can be burned in a biomass power
station to produce electricity.

\subsubsection*{Hydrogen} Through the process of 'electrolysis'
electricity (hopefully clean, renewable electricity!) can split
water into hydrogen and oxygen. The stored hydrogen can be used in a
'fuel cell' to create electricity in a process that is opposite to
electrolysis; to drive electric motors in a car. The hydrogen can also be burned directly in a modified internal combustion engine. In both cases the 'waste' product is water.

\essaytitle[Pressure and Forces]

In the mining industry, the roof (hangingwall) tends to drop as the
face of the tunnel (stope) is excavated for rock containing gold.

As one can imagine, a roof falling on one's head is not a nice
prospect! Therefore the roof needs to be supported.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../EssayPressure1.eps}
\end{figure}

The roof is not one big uniform chunk of rock. Rather it is broken
up into smaller chunks. It is assumed that the biggest chunk of rock
in the roof has a mass of less than 20 000 kgs therefore each
support has to be designed to resist a force related to that mass.
The strength of the material (either wood or steel) making up the
support is taken into account when working out the minimum required
size and thickness of the parts to withstand the force of the roof.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../EssayPressure2.eps}
\end{figure}


Sometimes the design of the support is such that the support needs
to withstand the rock mass without the force breaking the roof..

Therefore hydraulic supports (hydro = water) use the principles of
force and pressure such that as a force is exerted on the support,
the water pressure increases. A pressure relief valve then squirts
out water when the pressure (and thus the force) gets too large.
Imagine a very large, modified doctor's syringe.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering

In the petrochemical industry, there are many vessels and pipes that
are under high pressures. A vessel is a containment unit (Imagine a
pot without handles, that has the lid welded to the pot  that would
be a small vessel) where chemicals mix and react to form other
chemicals, amongst other uses.

The end product chemicals are sold to companies that use these
chemicals to make shampoo, dishwashing liquid, plastic containers,
fertilizer, etc. Anyway, some of these chemical reactions require
high temperatures and pressures in order to work. These pressures
result in forces being applied to the insides of the vessels and
pipes. Therefore the minimum thickness of the pipe and vessels walls
must be determined using calculations, to withstand these forces.
These calculations take into account the strength of the material
(typically steel, plastic or composite), the diameter and of course
the pressure inside the equipment. Let examine the concepts of
force and pressure in further detail.
