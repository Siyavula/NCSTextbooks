\section{Introduction}
This chapter focuses on vectors. We will learn what is a vector and how it differs from everyday numbers. We will also learn how to add, subtract and multiply them and where they appear in Physics.

Are vectors Physics? No, vectors themselves are not Physics. Physics is just a description of the world around us. To describe something we need to use a language. The most common language used to describe Physics is Mathematics. Vectors form a very important part of the mathematical description of Physics, so much so that it is
absolutely essential to master the use of vectors. 

\section{Scalars and Vectors}
In Mathematics, you learned that a number is something that represents a quantity. For example if you have 5 books, 6 apples and 1 bicycle, the 5, 6, and 1 represent how many of each item you have.

These kinds of numbers are known as \textit{scalars}.

\Definition{Scalar}{A scalar is a quantity that has only magnitude (size).}

An extension to a scalar is a vector, which is a scalar with a direction. For example, if you travel 1 km down Main Road to school, the quantity \textbf{1 km down Main Road} is a vector. The ``\textbf{1 km}'' is the quantity (or scalar) and the ``\textbf{down Main Road}'' gives a direction. 

In Physics we use the word \textit{magnitude} to refer to the scalar part of the vector.

\Definition{Vectors}{A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction.}

A vector should tell you \emph{how much} and \emph{which way}. 

For example, a man is driving his car east along a freeway at 100 \kph. What we have given here is a vector -- the velocity. The car is moving at 100 \kph (this is the magnitude) and we know where it is going -- east (this is the direction). Thus, we know the speed and direction of the car. These two quantities, a magnitude and a direction, form a vector we call velocity.

\section{Notation}
Vectors are different to scalars and therefore have their own notation. 

\subsection{Mathematical Representation}
There are many ways of writing the symbol for a vector. Vectors are denoted by symbols with an arrow pointing to the right above it. For example, $\vec{a}$, $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{F}$ represent the vectors acceleration, velocity and force, meaning they have both a magnitude and a direction. 

Sometimes just the magnitude of a vector is needed. In this case, the arrow is omitted. In other words, $F$ denotes the magnitude of the vector $\vec{F}$. $|\vec{F}|$ is another way of representing the magnitude of a vector. 

\subsection{Graphical Representation}
Vectors are drawn as arrows. An arrow has both a magnitude (how long it is) and a direction (the direction in which it points). The starting point of a vector is known as the \textit{tail} and the end point is known as the \textit{head}.

\section{Directions}
There are many acceptable methods of writing vectors. As long as the vector has a magnitude and a direction, it is most likely acceptable. These different methods come from the different methods of expressing a direction for a vector. 

\subsection{Relative Directions}
The simplest method of expressing direction is with relative directions: to the left, to the right, forward, backward, up and down.

\subsection{Compass Directions}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
Another common method of expressing directions is to use the points of a compass: North, South, East, and West. \\
\\
If a vector does not point exactly in one of the compass directions, then we use an angle. For example, we can have a vector pointing 40$^\circ$ North of West. Start with the vector pointing along the West direction:\\
\\
Then rotate the vector towards the north until there is a 40$^\circ$ angle between the vector and the West.\\

The direction of this vector can also be described as: W 40$^\circ$ N (West 40$^\circ$ North); or N 50$^\circ$ W (North 50$^\circ$ West)

\psline{->}(1,-1)(-1,-1)
\rput(0.35,-0.75){40$^\circ$}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Bearing}
The final method of expressing direction is to use a \textit{bearing}. A bearing is a direction relative to a fixed point. 

Given just an angle, the convention is to define the angle with respect to the North. So, a vector with a direction of 110$^\circ$ has been rotated clockwise 110$^\circ$ relative to the North. A bearing is always written as a three digit number, for example 275$^\circ$ or 080$^\circ$ (for 80$^\circ$).

		\end{pspicture}}
	\end{enumerate}}
\end{enumerate}
}

\section{Drawing Vectors}
In order to draw a vector accurately we must specify a scale and
include a reference direction in the diagram. A scale allows us to
translate the length of the arrow into the vector's magnitude. For
instance if one chose a scale of 1 cm = 2 N (1 cm represents 2 N), a
force of 20 N towards the East would be represented as an arrow 10 cm
long. A reference direction may be a line representing a horizontal surface or the points of a compass.

%Introduce vectors as arrows. Show all the properties just using arrows.
%Then introduce displacement, velocity and acceleration as vectors.
%Then we have established what vectors and acceleration are before we start forces.

%\MarginTip{Using vectors is an important skill you \textbf{must} master!}

Vectors are mathematical objects and we need to understand the mathematical properties of vectors, like adding and subtracting. 

For all the examples in this section, we will use displacement as our vector quantity. Displacement was discussed in 
Grade 10.%Chapter~\ref{p:m1d10}.
 Displacement is defined as the distance together with direction of the straight line joining a final point to an initial point. 

Remember that displacement is just one example of a vector. We could just as well have decided to use forces or velocities to illustrate the properties of vectors.

\subsection{Adding Vectors}
When vectors are added, we need to add both a magnitude \textbf{and} a direction. For example, take 2 steps in the forward direction, stop and then take another 3 steps in the forward direction. The first 2 steps is a displacement vector and the second 3 steps is also a displacement vector. If we did not stop after the first 2 steps, we would have taken 5 steps in the forward direction in total. Therefore, if we add the displacement vectors for 2 steps and 3 steps, we should get a total of 5 steps in the forward direction. Graphically, this can be seen by first following the first vector two steps forward and then following the second one three steps forward (ie. in the same direction): 

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-6,-1)(5,0.5)%%\psgrid
%\psgrid[gridcolor=lightgray]
\uput[u](-5,0){2 steps}
\psline{->}(-6,0)(-4,0)
\rput(-3.8,0){+}
\uput[u](-2.1,0){3 steps}
\psline{->}(-3.6,0)(-0.6,0)
\rput(-0.4,0.){=}
\psline{->}(-0.2,0)(1.8,0)
\psline{->}(1.8,0)(4.8,0)
\rput(-0.4,-1){=}
\uput[u](2.3,-1){5 steps}
\psline{->}(-0.2,-1)(4.8,-1)
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}
We add the second vector at the end of the first vector, since this is where we now are after the first vector has acted. The vector from the tail of the
first vector (the starting point) to the head of the last (the end
point) is then the sum of the vectors. This is the \textit{head-to-tail} method of vector addition.

As you can convince yourself, the order in which you add vectors does
not matter. In the example above, if you decided to first go 3 steps
forward and then another 2 steps forward, the end result would still be 5
steps forward.

The final answer when adding vectors is called the \emph{resultant}. The resultant displacement in this case will be 5 steps forward.

\Definition{Resultant of Vectors}{The resultant of a number of vectors is the single vector whose effect is the same as the individual vectors acting together.}

In other words, the individual vectors can be replaced by the
resultant -- the overall effect is the same. If vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ have a resultant $\vec{R}$, this can be represented mathematically as,

\begin{eqnarray*}
\vec{R} &=& \vec{a} + \vec{b}.
\end{eqnarray*}

Let us consider some more examples of vector addition using displacements. The arrows tell you how far to move and in what
direction. Arrows to the right correspond to steps forward, while
arrows to the left correspond to steps backward. Look at all of the
examples below and check them. 

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(0,0)(8,0.5)%%\psgrid
%\psgrid[gridcolor=lightgray]
\uput[u](0.48,0){1 step}
\psline{->}(1,0)
\rput(1.3,0){+}
\rput[u](2.08,0.325){1 step}
\psline{->}(1.6,0)(2.6,0)
\rput(2.9,-0.025){=}
\uput[u](4.18,0){2 steps}
\psline{->}(3.2,0)(4.2,0)
\psline{->}(4.2,0)(5.2,0)
\rput(5.5,-0.025){=}
\uput[u](6.78,0){2 steps}
\psline{->}(5.8,0)(7.8,0)
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
This example says 1 step forward and then another step forward is the same as an arrow twice as long -- two steps forward.\\

\begin{pspicture}(0,0)(8,1)%%\psgrid
%\psgrid[gridcolor=lightgray]
\rput(0.48,0.25){{1 step}}
\psline{<-}(1,0)
\rput(1.3,0){+}
\rput(2.08,0.25){{1 step}}
\psline{<-}(1.6,0)(2.6,0)
\rput(2.9,-0.025){=}
\rput(4.18,0.25){{2 steps}}
\psline{<-}(3.2,0)(4.2,0)
\psline{<-}(4.2,0)(5.2,0)
\rput(5.5,-0.025){=}
\rput(6.78,0.25){{2 steps}}
\psline{<-}(5.8,0)(7.8,0)
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

This examples says 1 step backward and then another step backward is the same as an arrow twice as long -- two steps backward.\\

It is sometimes possible that you end up back where you started. In this case the net result of what you have done is that you have gone nowhere
(your start and end points are at the same place). In this case, your resultant displacement is a vector with length zero units. We use the symbol $\vec{0}$ to denote such a vector:

\begin{center}

\psline{<-}(3.7,-0.05)(4.7,-0.05)
\rput(4.18,-0.28){{1 step}}
\rput(5.5,0){= $\vec{0}$}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

\rput(4.18,0.25){{1 step}}
\psline{<-}(3.7,0.05)(4.7,0.05)

seen as steps left and arrows down the page as steps right.

It is important to realise that the directions are not special-- `forward

true of any set of parallel directions:

In the above examples the separate displacements were parallel to one
another. However the same head-to-tail technique of vector addition
can be applied to vectors in any direction.

Now you have discovered one use for vectors; describing resultant
displacement -- how far and in what direction you 
have travelled after a series of movements.

Although vector addition here has been demonstrated with
displacements, all vectors behave in exactly the same way. Thus, if
given a number of forces acting on a body you can use the same method
to determine the resultant force acting on the body. We will return to
vector addition in more detail later. 

\subsection{Subtracting Vectors}

What does it mean to subtract a vector? Well this is really simple; if
we have 5 apples and we subtract 3 apples, we have only 2 apples left. Now
lets work in steps; if we take 5 steps forward and then subtract 3 steps
forward we are left with only two steps forward:

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-6,-0.5)(5,0.5)%%\psgrid
%\psgrid[gridcolor=lightgray]
\rput(-3.5,0.25){{5 steps}}
\psline{->}(-6,0)(-1,0)
\rput(-0.8,0){-}
\rput(1.1,0.25){{3 steps}}
\psline{->}(-0.6,0)(2.6,0)
\rput(2.8,0.){=}
\psline{->}(3.0,0)(5.0,0)
\rput(4.0,0.25){{2 steps}}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

What have we done? You originally took 5 steps forward but then you took
3 steps back. That backward displacement would be represented by an arrow 
pointing to the left (backwards) with length 3. The net result of
adding these two vectors is 2 steps forward:

\begin{center}

\begin{pspicture}(-6,-0.5)(5,0.5)%%\psgrid
%\psgrid[gridcolor=lightgray]
\uput[u](-3.5,0){{5 steps}}
\psline{->}(-6,0)(-1,0)
\rput(-0.8,0){+}
\uput[u](1.1,0){{3 steps}}
\psline{<-}(-0.6,0)(2.6,0)
\rput(2.8,0.){=}
\psline{->}(3.0,0)(5.0,0)
\uput[u](4.0,0){{2 steps}}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

Thus, subtracting a vector from another is the same as adding a vector in the opposite direction (i.e. subtracting 3 steps forwards is the same
as adding 3 steps backwards). 

\Tip{Subtracting a vector from another is the same as adding a vector in the opposite direction.}

In the problem, motion in the forward direction has been represented by an arrow to the right. Arrows to the right are positive and arrows to the left are negative. More generally, vectors in opposite directions differ in sign (i.e. if we define up as positive, then 
vectors acting down are negative). Thus, changing the sign of a vector
simply reverses its direction:

In mathematical form, subtracting $\vec{a}$ from
$\vec{b}$ gives a new vector $\vec{c}$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\vec{c} &=& \vec{b} - \vec{a}\\
&=& \vec{b} + (-\vec{a})
\end{eqnarray*}
This clearly shows that subtracting vector $\vec{a}$ from
$\vec{b}$ is the same as adding $(-\vec{a})$ to
$\vec{b}$. Look at the following examples of vector
subtraction.

\subsection{Scalar Multiplication}

What happens when you multiply a vector by a scalar (an ordinary
number)?

Going back to normal multiplication we know that $2 \times 2$ is just
$2$ groups of $2$ added together to give $4$. We can adopt a similar  approach to understand how vector multiplication works.

\section{Techniques of Vector Addition}

Now that you have learned about the mathematical properties of
vectors, we return to vector addition in more detail. There are a number of
techniques of vector addition. These techniques fall into two main categories - graphical and algebraic techniques.

\subsection{Graphical Techniques}
Graphical techniques involve drawing accurate scale diagrams to denote
individual vectors and their resultants. We next discuss the two primary
graphical techniques, the head-to-tail technique and the parallelogram
method. 

\subsubsection{The Head-to-Tail Method}
In describing the mathematical properties of vectors we used
displacements and the head-to-tail graphical method of vector addition
as an illustration. The head-to-tail method of graphically adding vectors is a standard method that must be understood.\\

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\textbf{Method: Head-to-Tail Method of Vector Addition}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Draw a rough sketch of the situation.}
\item{Choose a scale and include a reference direction.}
\item{Choose any of the vectors and draw it as an arrow in the
correct direction and of the correct length -- remember to put an
arrowhead on the end to denote its direction.}
\item{Take the next vector and draw it as an arrow starting from the
arrowhead of the first vector in the correct direction and of the
correct length.}
\item{Continue until you have drawn each vector -- each time starting
from the head of the previous vector. In this way, the vectors to be
added are drawn one after the other head-to-tail.}
\item{The resultant is then the vector drawn from the tail of the
first vector to the head of the last. Its magnitude can be
determined from the length of its arrow using the scale. Its
direction too can be determined from the scale diagram.}
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}

\begin{wex}{Head-to-Tail Addition I}{A ship leaves harbour H and sails 6 km north to port A. From here the ship travels 12 km east to port B, before sailing 5,5 km south-west to port C. Determine the ship's resultant displacement using the head-to-tail technique of vector addition.}{

\westep{Draw a rough sketch of the situation}
Its easy to understand the problem if we first draw a quick sketch. The rough sketch should include all of the information given in the problem. All of the magnitudes of the displacements are shown and a compass has been included as a reference direction. In a rough sketch one is interested in the approximate shape of the vector diagram.

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-4,-4)(4,0.5)

\psline[arrowscale=2]{->}(-3.8,-3.8)(-3.8,0)

\psline[arrowscale=2]{->}(-3.8,-3.8)(1.11,-2.69)
\end{pspicture}
\scalebox{0.7}{\pscompass}
\end{center}

\westep{Choose a scale and include a reference direction.}
The choice of scale depends on the actual question -- you should choose a
scale such that your vector diagram fits the page. 

It is clear from the rough sketch that choosing a scale where 1~cm represents 2~km (scale: 1~cm = 2~km) would be a good choice in this 
problem. The diagram will then take up a good fraction of an A4 page. We now start the accurate construction.

\westep{Choose any of the vectors to be summed and draw it as an arrow in the correct direction and of the correct length -- remember to put an
arrowhead on the end to denote its direction.}
Starting at the harbour H we draw the first vector 3~cm long in the direction north.

\westep{Take the next vector and draw it as an arrow starting from the

Since the ship is now at port A we draw the second vector 6~cm long starting from point A in the direction east.

\scalebox{0.7}{\pscompass}
\end{center}

\westep{Take the next vector and draw it as an arrow starting from the
head of the second vector in the correct direction and of the
correct length.}
Since the ship is now at port B we draw the third vector 2,25~cm long starting from this point in the direction south-west. A protractor is required to measure the angle of 45$^\circ$.

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(0,0)(8,3.5)

\rput(5.7,2.65){45$^\circ$}
\end{pspicture}
\scalebox{0.7}{\pscompass}
\end{center}

\westep{The resultant is then the vector drawn from the tail of the
first vector to the head of the last. Its magnitude can be
determined from the length of its arrow using the scale. Its
direction too can be determined from the scale diagram.}

As a final step we draw the resultant displacement from
the starting point (the harbour H) to the end point (port C). We use a
ruler to measure the length of this arrow and a protractor to determine its direction.

\begin{center}

\end{pspicture}
\scalebox{0.7}{\pscompass}
\end{center}

\westep{Apply the scale conversion}
We now use the scale to convert the length of the resultant in the scale diagram to the actual displacement in the problem. Since we have chosen a scale of 1~cm = 2~km in this problem the resultant has a magnitude of 9,2~km. The direction can be specified in terms of the angle measured either as 072,3$^\circ$ east of north or on a bearing of 072,3$^\circ$.

\westep{Quote the final answer}
The resultant displacement of the ship is 9,2 km on a bearing of 072,3$^\circ$.}

\scalebox{0.7}{\pscompass}
\end{center}

\westep{Determine the distance that the man traveled}
In the first part of his journey he traveled 40 m and in the second part he traveled 30 m. This gives us a total distance traveled of 40 m + 30 m = 70 m.

\westep{Determine his resultant displacement}
The man's resultant displacement is the {\bf vector} from where he started to where he ended. It is the vector sum of his two separate displacements. We will use the head-to-tail method of accurate construction to find this vector. 

\westep{Choose a suitable scale}
A scale of 1 cm represents 10 m (1~cm = 10~m) is a good choice here. Now we can begin the process of construction.

\westep{Draw the first vector to scale}
We draw the first displacement as an arrow 4~cm long in an eastwards direction.

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-0.5,-0.5)(6,0.5)

\psline[arrowscale=2]{->}(0,0)(4,0)

\end{center}

\westep{Draw the second vector to scale}
Starting from the head of the first vector we draw the second vector as an arrow 3~cm long in a northerly direction.

\uput[r](4,1.5){3 cm = 30 m}
\end{pspicture}
\scalebox{0.7}{\pscompass}
\end{center}

\westep{Determine the resultant vector}
Now we connect the starting point to the end point and
measure the length and direction of this arrow (the resultant).

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-0.5,-0.5)(6,3)
%\psgrid[gridcolor=lightgray]
\psline[arrowscale=2]{->}(0,0)(4,0)

\rput(0.85,0.25){?}
\end{pspicture}
\scalebox{0.7}{\pscompass}
\end{center}

\westep{Find the direction}
To find the direction you measure the angle between the resultant and the 40~m vector. You should get about 37$^\circ$.

\westep{Apply the scale conversion}
Finally we use the scale to convert the length of the resultant in
the scale diagram to the actual magnitude of the resultant
displacement. According to the chosen scale 1 cm = 10 m. Therefore 5 cm  represents 50 m. The resultant displacement is then 50 m 37$^\circ$ north of east.
}
\end{wex}

\subsubsection{The Parallelogram Method}

The \textit{parallelogram method} is another graphical technique of finding the resultant of two vectors.\\

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\textbf{Method: The Parallelogram Method}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Make a rough sketch of the vector diagram.}
\item{Choose a scale and a reference direction.}
\item{Choose either of the vectors to be added and draw it as an arrow
of the correct length in the correct direction.}
\item{Draw the second vector as an arrow of the correct length in the
correct direction from the tail of the first vector.}
\item{Complete the parallelogram formed by these two vectors.}
\item{The resultant is then the diagonal of the parallelogram. The 
magnitude can be determined from the length of its arrow using the
scale. The direction too can be determined from the scale diagram.}
\end{enumerate}

\westep{Choose a suitable scale}
In this problem a scale of 1~cm = 1~N would be appropriate, since then the vector diagram would take up a reasonable fraction of the page. We can now begin the accurate scale diagram.

The resultant has a measured length of 8,7 cm.

\westep{Find the direction}
We use a protractor to measure the angle between the horizontal and the resultant. We get 13,3$^\circ$.

\westep{Apply the scale conversion}
Finally we use the scale to convert the measured length into the 
actual magnitude. Since 1 cm = 1 N, 8,7 cm represents 8,7 N. Therefore the resultant force is 8,7 N at 13,3$^\circ$ above the horizontal.} 
\end{wex}

The parallelogram method is restricted to the addition of just two
vectors. However, it is arguably the most intuitive way of adding two
forces acting on a point.

\subsection{Algebraic Addition and Subtraction of Vectors}
\subsubsection{Vectors in a Straight Line}

Whenever you are faced with adding vectors acting in a straight line (i.e. some directed left and some right, or some acting up and others down) you can use a very simple algebraic technique:\\

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\textbf{Method: Addition/Subtraction of Vectors in a Straight Line}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Choose a positive direction. As an example, for
situations involving displacements in the directions west and east, you
might choose west as your positive direction. In that case,
displacements east are negative.}
\item{Next simply add (or subtract) the
magnitude of the vectors using the appropriate signs.}
\item{As a final step the direction of the resultant should be included in
words (positive answers are in the positive direction, while negative
resultants are in the negative direction).}\\
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}

Let us consider a few examples. 

\begin{wex}{Adding vectors algebraically I}{A tennis ball is rolled towards a wall which is 10~m away from the ball. If after striking the wall the ball rolls a further 2,5~m along the ground away from the wall, calculate algebraically the ball's resultant displacement.}{
\westep{Draw a rough sketch of the situation}
\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-0.5,-0.5)(6,2)
%\psgrid[gridcolor=lightgray]
\psline{->}(0,1.5)(5,1.5)
\rput(2.5,1.7){10 m}
\psline{->}(5,1)(3.75,1)
\rput(4.5,1.2){2,5 m}
\psline{-}(5,0)(5,2)
\rput(5.5,1){Wall}
\psline[linestyle=dashed]{-}(0,0)(0,2)
\rput(0,-0.2){Start}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center} 
\westep{Decide which method to use to calculate the resultant}
We know that the resultant displacement of the ball
($\vec{x}_{R}$) is equal to the sum of the ball's separate
displacements ($\vec{x}_1$ and $\vec{x}_2$):
\begin{eqnarray*}
\vec{x}_{R} & = & \vec{x}_{1} + \vec{x}_{2}
\end{eqnarray*}
Since the motion of the ball is in a straight line (i.e. the ball
moves towards and away from the wall), we can use the method of algebraic addition
just explained.
\westep{Choose a positive direction}
Let's choose the \textbf{positive} direction to be towards the wall. This means that the \textbf{negative} direction is away from the wall. 

\westep{Now define our vectors algebraically}
With right positive: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\vec{x}_{1} & = & +10,0\emm \\
\vec{x}_{2} & = & -2,5\emm 
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Add the vectors}
Next we simply add the two displacements to give the resultant:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\vec{x}_{R} & = & (+10\emm) + (-2,5\emm) \\
& = & (+7,5)\emm
\end{eqnarray*}
\westep{Quote the resultant}
Finally, in this case \underline{towards the wall is the positive direction}, so:
$\vec{x}_{R}$  =  7,5 m towards the wall.}
\end{wex}

\begin{wex}{Subtracting vectors algebraically I}{Suppose that a tennis ball is thrown horizontally towards a wall at an initial velocity of 3 \ms to the right. After striking the wall, the ball returns to the thrower at 2 \ms. Determine the change in velocity of the ball.}{
\westep{Draw a sketch}
A quick sketch will help us understand the problem.
\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-0.5,-0.5)(4,2)
%\psgrid[gridcolor=lightgray]
\psline{->}(0,1.5)(3,1.5)
\rput(1.5,1.7){3 \ms}
\psline{->}(3,1)(1,1)
\rput(2,1.2){2 \ms}
\psline{-}(3,0)(3,2)
\rput(3.5,1){Wall}
\psline[linestyle=dashed]{-}(0,0)(0,2)
\rput(0,-0.2){Start}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center} 
\westep{Decide which method to use to calculate the resultant}
Remember that velocity is a vector. The change in the velocity of the
ball is equal to the difference between the ball's initial and final
velocities: 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta\vec{v}  =  \vec{v}_{f} - \vec{v}_{i} 
\end{equation*}

Since the ball moves along a straight line (i.e. left and right), we
can use the algebraic technique of vector subtraction just discussed.

\westep{Choose a positive direction} 
Choose the \textbf{positive} direction to be towards the wall. This means that the \textbf{negative} direction is away from the wall. 

\westep{Now define our vectors algebraically}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\vec{v}_{i} & = & +3\ems \\
\vec{v}_{f} & = & -2\ems 
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Subtract the vectors}
Thus, the change in velocity of the ball is:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta\vec{v} & = & (-2\ems) - (+3\ems) \\
& = & (-5)\ems
\end{eqnarray*}
\westep{Quote the resultant}
Remember that in this case \underline{towards the wall means a positive velocity}, so \underline{away from the wall means a negative velocity}:
$\Delta\vec{v} =  5\ems$ away from the wall.}
\end{wex}

\Exercise{Resultant Vectors}{

	\item What is the resultant velocity of the squash ball?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
}

Remember that the technique of addition and subtraction just discussed can only be applied to vectors acting along a straight line. When vectors are not in a straight line, i.e. at an angle to each other, the following method can be used:

\subsubsection{A More General Algebraic technique}
Simple geometric and trigonometric techniques can be used to find resultant vectors.

\begin{wex}{An Algebraic Solution I}{A man walks 40 m East, then 30 m North. Calculate the man's resultant displacement.\\}{
\westep{Draw a rough sketch}
As before, the rough sketch looks as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-0.5,-0.5)(6,3)
%\psgrid[gridcolor=lightgray]

\uput[r](4,1.5){30 m}
\uput[r](0.5,0.2){$\alpha$}
\end{pspicture}
\scalebox{0.7}{\pscompass}
\end{center}

\westep{Determine the length of the resultant}
Note that the triangle formed by his separate displacement vectors and his resultant displacement vector is a right-angle triangle. We can thus use the Theorem of Pythagoras to determine the length of the resultant. Let $x_R$ represent the length of the resultant vector. Then:
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_R^2&=&(40\emm)^2 + (30\emm)^2\\
x_R^2&=&2\ 500\emm^2\\
x_R&=&50\emm
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Determine the direction of the resultant} 
Now we have the length of the resultant displacement vector but not yet its direction. To determine its direction we calculate the angle $\alpha$ between the resultant displacement vector and East, by using simple trigonometry:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tan \alpha &=& \frac{\mathrm{opposite side}}{\mathrm{adjacent side}}\\
\tan \alpha &=& \frac{30}{40}\\
\alpha& =& \tan^{-1} (0,75) \\
\alpha &=& 36,9^\circ
\end{eqnarray*}
\westep{Quote the resultant}
The resultant displacement is then 50~m at 36,9$^\circ$ North of East. 

This is exactly the same answer we arrived at after drawing a scale diagram!}
\end{wex}

In the previous example we were able to use simple trigonometry to
calculate the resultant displacement. This was possible since the
directions of motion were perpendicular (north and east).
Algebraic techniques, however, are not limited to cases where the vectors to be combined are along the same straight line or at right angles to one
another. The following example illustrates this.

\begin{wex}{An Algebraic Solution II}{A man walks from point A to point B which is 12~km away on a bearing of 45$^\circ$. From point B the man walks a further 8~km east to point C. Calculate the resultant displacement.\\}{

\end{center}
$B\hat{A}F = 45^\circ$ since the man walks initially on a bearing of 45$^\circ$.
Then, $A\hat{B}G = B\hat{A}F = 45^\circ$ (parallel lines, alternate angles). Both of these angles are included in the rough sketch.\\

\westep{Calculate the length of the resultant} 
The resultant is the vector AC. Since we know both
the lengths of AB and BC and the included angle $A\hat{B}C$, we can use
the cosine rule:

\begin{eqnarray*}
AC^2 &=& AB^2 +BC^2 - 2\cdot AB\cdot BC\cos(A\hat{B}C)\\
&=& (12)^2 + (8)^2 - 2\cdot (12)(8)\cos(135^\circ)\\
&=& 343,8 \\
AC &=& 18,5\ \mathrm{km}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Determine the direction of the resultant}
Next we use the sine rule to determine the angle $\theta$:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\sin\theta}{8}&=&\frac{\sin 135^\circ}{18,5}\\
\sin\theta &=& \frac{8\times\sin 135^\circ}{18,5}\\
\theta &=& \sin^{-1}(0,3058)\\
\theta &=& 17,8^\circ
\end{eqnarray*}
To find $F\hat{A}C$, we add 45$^\circ$.
Thus, $F\hat{A}C=62,8^\circ$.\\

\westep{Quote the resultant}
The resultant displacement is therefore 18,5 km on a bearing of 062,8$^\circ$.}

\section{Components of Vectors}
In the discussion of vector addition we saw that a number of vectors acting
together can be combined to give a single vector (the resultant). In
much the same way a single vector can be broken down into a number of vectors which when added give that original vector. These vectors which sum to the original are called {\bf components} of the original vector. The process of breaking a vector into its components is called {\bf resolving into components}.

While summing a given set of vectors gives just one answer (the
resultant), a single vector can be resolved into infinitely many sets
of components. In the diagrams below the same black vector is resolved
into different pairs of components. These components are shown as dashed lines. When added together the dashed vectors give the original black vector
(i.e. the original vector is the resultant of its components).

\begin{center}

In practice it is most useful to resolve a vector into components
which are at right angles to one another, usually horizontal and vertical.

Any vector can be resolved into a horizontal and a vertical component. If $\vec{A}$ is a vector, then the horizontal component of $\vec{A}$ is $\vec{A}_x$ and the vertical component is $\vec{A}_y$.

components form a right-angled triangle with the original displacement
as its hypotenuse.

Notice how the two components acting together give the original vector as
their resultant.

\westep{Determine the lengths of the component vectors}
Now we can use trigonometry to calculate the magnitudes of the
components of the original displacement:
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_N &=& (250) (\sin{30^\circ})\\
&=& 125\ \mathrm{km}
\end{eqnarray*}
and
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_E &=& (250)(\cos{30^\circ})\\
&=& 216,5\ \mathrm{km}
\end{eqnarray*}

Remember $x_N$ and $x_E$ are the magnitudes of the components -- they
are in the directions north and east respectively.}
\end{wex}

\Extension{Block on an incline}{
As a further example of components let us consider a block of mass $m$
placed on a frictionless surface inclined at some angle $\theta$ to
the horizontal. The block will obviously slide down the incline, but
what causes this motion?

The forces acting on the block are its weight $mg$ and the normal
force $N$ exerted by the surface on the object. These two forces are
shown in the diagram below. 

\begin{center}

\end{pspicture*}
\end{center}

Now the object's weight can be resolved into components parallel and
perpendicular to the inclined surface. These components are shown as
dashed arrows in the diagram above and are at right angles to each
other. The components have been drawn acting from the same
point. Applying the parallelogram method, the two components of the
block's weight sum to the weight vector. 

To find the components in terms of the weight we can use trigonometry:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{g \parallel} &=& mg\sin\theta\\
F_{g \perp} &=& mg\cos\theta
\end{eqnarray*}
The component of the weight perpendicular to the slope $F_{g \perp}$
exactly balances the normal force $N$ exerted by the surface. The
parallel component, however, $F_{g \parallel}$ is unbalanced and causes
the block to slide down the slope.

\subsection{Vector addition using components}
Components can also be used to find the resultant of vectors. This technique can be applied to both graphical and algebraic methods of finding the resultant. The method is simple: make a rough sketch of the problem, find the horizontal and vertical components of each vector, find the sum of all horizontal components and the sum of all the vertical components and then use them to find the resultant.

Consider the two vectors, $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$, in Figure~\ref{fig:p:v:components:addition:vectors}, together with their resultant, $\vec{R}$. 

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\begin{center}

\end{pspicture}
}
\end{center}
\caption{An example of two vectors being added to give a resultant}
\label{fig:p:v:components:addition:vectors}
\end{figure}

Each vector in Figure~\ref{fig:p:v:components:addition:vectors} can be broken down into one component in the $x$-direction (horizontal) and one in the $y$-direction (vertical). These components are two vectors which when added give you the original vector as the resultant. This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:p:v:components:addition:vectors:components} where we can see that:

\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\vec{A}&=&\vec{A}_x+\vec{A}_y\\
\vec{B}&=&\vec{B}_x+\vec{B}_y\\
\vec{R}&=&\vec{R}_x+\vec{R}_y\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{But,}\quad \vec{R}_x&=&\vec{A}_x+\vec{B}_x\\
\mbox{and}\quad\vec{R}_y&=&\vec{A}_y+\vec{B}_y\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{minipage}

In summary, addition of the $x$ components of the two original
vectors gives the $x$ component of the resultant. The same applies to
the $y$ components. So if we just added all the components 
together we would get the same answer! This is another important
property of vectors.

\westep{Decide how to tackle the problem} 
The first thing we must realise is that the order that we add the vectors does not matter. Therefore, we can work through the vectors to be added in any order.

\westep{Resolve $\vec{A}$ into components}
We find the components of $\vec{A}$ by using known trigonometric ratios. First we find the magnitude of the vertical component, $A_y$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sin \theta &=& \frac{A_y}{A} \\
\sin{21,8^\circ} &=& \frac{A_y}{5,385}\\
A_y &=& (5,385)(\sin{21,8^\circ})\\
 &=& 2\emm
\end{eqnarray*}

Secondly we find the magnitude of the horizontal component, $A_x$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\cos \theta &=& \frac{A_x}{A} \\
\cos{21.8^\circ} &=& \frac{A_x}{5,385}\\
A_x &=& (5,385) (\cos{21,8^\circ})\\
 &=& 5\emm
\end{eqnarray*}

The components give the sides of the right angle triangle, for which the original vector, $\vec{A}$, is the hypotenuse. 

\westep{Resolve $\vec{B}$ into components}
We find the components of $\vec{B}$ by using known trigonometric ratios. First we find the magnitude of the vertical component, $B_y$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sin{\theta} & = & \frac{B_y}{B} \\
\sin{53,13^\circ} & = &\frac{B_y}{5}\\
B_y & = & (5)(\sin{53,13^\circ})\\
 & = & 4\emm
\end{eqnarray*}

Secondly we find the magnitude of the horizontal component, $B_x$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\cos{\theta} &=& \frac{B_x}{B} \\
\cos{21,8^\circ} &=& \frac{B_x}{5,385}\\
B_x & = & (5,385) (\cos{53,13^\circ})\\
& = & 5\emm
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

\westep{Determine the components of the resultant vector}
Now we have all the components. If we add all the horizontal components then
we will have the $x$-component of the resultant vector, $\vec{R}_x$.  Similarly, we add all the vertical components then we will have the $y$-component of the resultant vector, $\vec{R}_y$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
R_x &=& A_x+B_x\\
&=&5\emm + 3\emm\\
&=&8\emm
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, $\vec{R}_x$ is 8 m to the right.
\begin{eqnarray*}
R_y &=& A_y+B_y\\
&=&2\emm + 4\emm\\
&=&6\emm
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, $\vec{R}_y$ is 6 m up.

\westep{Determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant vector}
Now that we have the components of the resultant, we can use the Theorem of Pythagoras to determine the magnitude of the resultant, $R$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
R^2&=&(R_x)^2 + (R_y)^2\\
R^2&=&(6)^2 + (8)^2\\
R^2&=&100\\
\therefore R&=&10\emm

The magnitude of the resultant, $R$ is 10 m.  So all we have to do is calculate its direction. We can specify the direction as the angle the vectors makes with a known direction. To do this you only need to visualise the vector as starting at the origin of a coordinate system. We have drawn this explicitly below and the angle we will calculate is labeled $\alpha$.

Using our known trigonometric ratios we can calculate the value of $\alpha$;
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tan \alpha & = & \frac{6 \emm}{8\emm} \\
\alpha & = & \tan^{-1} \frac{6\emm}{8\emm}\\
\alpha & = & 36,8^o.
\end{eqnarray*}
\westep{Quote the final answer}
$\vec{R}$ is 10 m at an angle of $36,8^\circ$ to the positive $x$-axis.}

\end{enumerate}
}

\Extension{Vector Multiplication}{
Vectors are special, they are more than just numbers. This means that multiplying vectors is not necessarily the same as just multiplying their magnitudes. There are two different types of multiplication defined for vectors. You can find the dot product of two vectors or the cross product.

The \textit{dot} product is most similar to regular multiplication between scalars. To take the dot product of two vectors, you just multiply their magnitudes to get out a scalar answer. The mathematical definition of the dot product is:
\begin{equation*}
\vec{a}\bullet \vec{b} = \lvert \vec{a} \rvert \cdot \lvert \vec{b} \rvert\cos \theta
\end{equation*}
 
Take two vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$:

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-5,-0.5)(1,1)
%\psgrid[gridcolor=lightgray]
\rput(-3.5,0.25){a}
\psline{->}(-5,0)(-1,0)
\rput(0,0.8){b}
\psline{->}(-1,0)(1,1)
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

You can draw in the component of $\vec{b}$ that is parallel to $\vec{a}$:

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-5,-0.5)(1,1)
%\psgrid[gridcolor=lightgray]
\rput(-3.5,0.25){a}
\psline{->}(-5,0)(-1,0)
\rput(0,0.8){b}
\psline{->}(-1,0)(1,1)
\psline[linestyle=dashed]{->}(-1,0)(1,0)
\rput(0,0.25){$\theta$}
\psline[linestyle=dashed]{->}(1,0)(1,1)
\psarc{-}(0,0.25){0.5}{330}{50}
\rput(0,-0.25){b}
\rput(0.5,-0.25){$\cos \theta$}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

In this way we can arrive at the definition of the dot product. You find how much of $\vec{b}$ is lined up with $\vec{a}$ by finding the component of $\vec{b}$ parallel to $\vec{a}$. Then multiply the magnitude of that component, $\lvert\vec{b}\rvert$ $ \cos \theta$, with the magnitude of $\vec{a}$ to get a scalar.\\

The second type of multiplication, the cross product, is more subtle and uses the directions of the vectors in a more complicated way. The cross product of two vectors, $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$, is written $\vec{a}\times\vec{b}$ and the result of this operation on $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ is another vector. The magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors is:
\begin{equation*}
\lvert \vec{a}\times \vec{b} \rvert = \lvert\vec{a}\rvert \lvert\vec{b}\rvert\sin \theta
\end{equation*}
 
We still need to find the direction of $\vec{a}\times\vec{b}$. We do this by applying the \textit{right hand rule}.\\

\begin{minipage}{0.75\textwidth}
\textbf{Method: Right Hand Rule}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using your right hand:
\item Point your index finger in the direction of $\vec{a}$.
\item Point the middle finger in the direction of $\vec{b}$. 
\item Your thumb will show the direction of $\vec{a}\times \vec{b}$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Summary}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A scalar is a physical quantity with magnitude only.

\item A vector is a physical quantity with magnitude and direction.

\item Vectors may be represented as arrows where the length of the arrow indicates the magnitude and the arrowhead indicates the direction of the vector.

\item The direction of a vector can be indicated by referring to another vector or a fixed point (eg. 30$^\circ$ from the river bank); using a compass (eg. N 30$^\circ$ W); or bearing (eg. 053$^\circ$).

\item Vectors can be added using the head-to-tail method, the parallelogram method or the component method.

\item The resultant of a number of vectors is the single vector whose effect is the same as the individual vectors acting together.

\chapter{Force, Momentum and Impulse - Grade 11}
\label{p:m:fmi11}



\section{Introduction}
In Grade 10 we studied motion but not what caused the motion. In this chapter we will learn that a net force is needed to cause motion. We recall what a force is and learn about how force and motion are related. We are introduced to two new concepts, momentum and impulse, and we learn more about turning forces and the force of gravity.

\section{Force}
%\nts{This section could do with more activities, notably some simple experiments.}

\subsection{What is a \textit{force}?}
A force is anything that can cause a change to objects. Forces can:
\begin{itemize}
\item change the shape of an object
\item accelerate or stop an object
\item change the direction of a moving object.
\end{itemize}

A force can be classified as either a \textit{contact force} or a \textit{non-contact force}.

A contact force must touch or \textit{be in contact} with an object to cause a change. Examples of contact forces are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the force that is used to push or pull things, like on a door to open or close it
\item the force that a sculptor uses to turn clay into a pot
\item the force of the wind to turn a windmill
\end{itemize}

%\Activity{Contact Forces}{Write down 5 examples (excluding those given above) of contact forces that you see on your way to school.}

A non-contact force does not have to touch an object to cause a change. Examples of non-contact forces are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the force due to gravity, like the Earth pulling the Moon towards itself
\item the force due to electricity, like a proton and an electron attracting each other
\item the force due to magnetism, like a magnet pulling a paper clip towards itself
\end{itemize}

The unit of force is the \emph{newton} (symbol \emph{N}). This unit is named after Sir Isaac Newton who first defined force. Force is a vector quantity and has a magnitude and a direction. We use the abbreviation \emph{F} for force.

\begin{IFact}{There is a popular story that while Sir Isaac Newton was sitting under an apple tree, an apple fell on his head, and he suddenly thought of the Universal Law of Gravitation. Coincidently, the weight of a small apple is approximately 1~N.}\end{IFact}

\begin{IFact}{Force was first described by Archimedes of Syracuse (circa 287 BC - 212 BC). Archimedes was a Greek mathematician, astronomer, philosopher, physicist and engineer. He was killed by a Roman soldier during the sack of the city, despite orders from the Roman general, Marcellus, that he was not to be harmed.}
\end{IFact}

This chapter will often refer to the \emph{resultant force} acting on an object. The resultant force is simply the vector sum of all the forces acting on the object. It is very important to remember that all the forces must be acting on the \emph{same} object. The resultant force is the force that has the same effect as all the other forces added together.

\subsection{Examples of Forces in Physics}
Most of Physics revolves around the study of forces. Although there are many different forces, all are handled in the same way. All forces in Physics can be put into one of four groups. These are gravitational forces, electromagnetic forces, strong nuclear forces and weak nuclear forces. You will mostly come across gravitational or electromagnetic forces at school.

\subsubsection{Gravitational Forces}
Gravity is the attractive force between two objects due to the mass of the objects. When you throw a ball in the air, its mass and the Earth's mass attract each other, which leads to a force between them. The ball falls back towards the Earth, and the Earth accelerates towards the ball. The movement of the Earth towards the ball is, however, so small that you couldn't possibly measure it.

\subsubsection{Electromagnetic Forces}
Almost all of the forces that we experience in everyday life are
electromagnetic in origin. They have this unusual name because long ago people thought that electric forces and magnetic forces were different things. After much work and experimentation, it has been realised that they are actually different manifestations of the same underlying theory.

\subsubsection{Electric or Electrostatic Forces}
If we have objects carrying electrical charge, which are not moving, then we are dealing with electrostatic forces (Coulomb's Law). This force is actually much stronger than gravity. This may seem strange, since gravity is obviously very powerful, and holding a balloon to the wall seems to be the most impressive thing electrostatic forces have done, but if we think about it: for gravity to be detectable, we need to have a very large mass nearby. But a balloon rubbed against someone's hair can stick to a wall with a force so strong that it overcomes the force of gravity between the entire Earth and the balloon---with just the charges in the balloon and the wall!

\subsubsection{Magnetic Forces}
The magnetic force is a different manifestation of the electromagnetic force. It stems from the interaction between \emph{moving charges} as opposed to the \emph{fixed} charges involved in Coulomb's Law. Examples of the magnetic force in action include magnets, compasses, car engines and computer data storage. Magnets are also used in the wrecking industry to pick up cars and move them around sites.

\subsubsection{Friction}
According to Newton's First Law (we will discuss this later in the chapter) an object moving \emph{without a force acting on it} will keep on moving. Then why does a box sliding on a table come to a stop? The answer is friction. Friction arises where two surfaces are in contact and moving relative to eachother as a result of the interaction between the molecules of the two contact surfaces---for instance the interactions between the molecules on the bottom of the box with molecules on the top of the table. This interaction is electromagnetic in origin, hence friction is just another view of the electromagnetic force. Later in this chapter we will discuss frictional forces a little more.

\subsubsection{Drag Forces}
This is the force an object experiences while travelling through a medium like an aeroplane flying through air. When something travels through the air it needs to displace air as it travels and because of this, the air exerts a force on the object. This becomes an important force when you move fast and a lot of thought is taken to try and reduce the amount of drag force a sports car or an aeroplane experiences. The drag force is very useful for parachutists. They jump from high altitudes and if there was no drag force, then they would continue accelerating all the way to the ground. Parachutes are wide because the more surface area you have, the greater the drag force and hence the slower you hit the ground.

\subsection{Systems and External Forces}
The concepts of systems and forces external to such systems are very important in Physics. A system is any collection of objects. If one draws an imaginary box around such a system then an external force is one that
is applied by an object or person outside the box. Imagine for example a car pulling two trailers.

If we draw a box around the two trailers they can be considered a closed system or unit. When we look at the forces on this closed system the following forces will apply (we assume drag forces are absent):
\begin{itemize}
\item The force of the car pulling the unit (trailer A and B)
\item The force of friction between the wheels of the trailers and the road (opposite to the direction of motion)
\item The force of the Earth pulling downwards on the system (gravity)
\item The force of the road pushing upwards on the system
\end{itemize}

These forces are called external forces to the system.\\
The following forces will not apply:
\begin{itemize}
\item The force of A pulling B
\item The force of B pulling A
\item The force of friction between the wheels of the car and the road (opposite to the direction of motion)
\end{itemize}

We can also draw a box around trailer A or B, in which case the forces will be different.

If we consider trailer A as a system, the following external forces will apply:
\begin{itemize}
\item The force of the car pulling on A (towards the right)
\item The force of B pulling on A (towards the left)
\item The force of the Earth pulling downwards on the trailer (gravity)
\item The force of the road pushing upwards on the trailer
\item The force of friction between the wheels of A and the road (opposite to the direction of motion)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Force Diagrams}
If we look at the example above and draw a force diagram of all the forces acting on the two-trailer-unit, the diagram would look like this:

It is important to keep the following in mind when you draw force diagrams:
\begin{itemize}
\item Make your drawing large and clear.
\item You must use arrows and the direction of the arrow will show the direction of the force.
\item The length of the arrow will indicate the size of the force, in other words, the longer arrows in the diagram (F$_1$ for example) indicates a bigger force than a shorter arrow (F$_f$). Arrows of the same length indicate forces of equal size (F$_N$ and F$_g$). Use ``little lines'' like in maths to show this.
\item Draw neat lines using a ruler. The arrows must touch the system or object.
\item All arrows must have labels. Use letters with a key on the side if you do not have enough space on your drawing.
\item The labels must indicate what is applying the force (the force of the car?) on what the force is applied (?on the trailer?) and in which direction (to the right)
\item If the values of the forces are known, these values can be added to the diagram or key.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Free Body Diagrams}
In a free-body diagram, the object of interest is drawn as a dot and all the forces acting on it are drawn as arrows pointing away from the dot.
A free body diagram for the two-trailer-system will therefore look like this:\\

\subsection{Finding the Resultant Force}
The easiest way to determine a resultant force is to draw a free body diagram. Remember from Chapter \ref{chap:vectors} that we use the length of the arrow to indicate the vector's magnitude and the direction of the arrow to show which direction it acts in.

After we have done this, we have a diagram of vectors and we simply find the sum of the vectors to get the resultant force.

}
\end{pspicture}
\caption{(a) Force diagram of 2 forces acting on a box. (b) Free body diagram of the box.}
\label{forces:1}
\end{center}

For example, two people push on a box from opposite sides with forces of 4~N and 6~N respectively as shown in Figure~\ref{forces:1}(a). The free body diagram in Figure~\ref{forces:1}(b) shows the object represented by a dot and the two forces are represented by arrows with their tails on the dot.

As you can see, the arrows point in opposite directions and have different lengths. The resultant force is 2~N to the left. This result can be obtained algebraically too, since the two forces act along the same line. First, as in motion in one direction, choose a frame of reference. Secondly, add the two vectors taking their directions into account.

For the example, assume that the positive direction is to the right, then:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{R} &=& (+4\eN)+(-6\eN)\\
&=& -2\eN\\
&=& 2 \eN~ \mbox{to the left}
\end{eqnarray*}

Remember that a negative answer means that the force acts in the \emph{opposite} direction to the one that you chose to be positive. You can \emph{choose} the positive direction to be any way you want, but once you have chosen it you \emph{must} keep it.

As you work with more force diagrams in which the forces exactly balance, you may notice that you get a zero answer (e.g. 0~N). This simply means that the forces are balanced and that the object will not accelerate.

Once a force diagram has been drawn the techniques of vector addition introduced in Chapter~\ref{chap:vectors} can be used. Depending on the situation you might choose to use a graphical technique such as the tail-to-head method or the parallelogram method, or else an algebraic approach to determine the resultant. Since force is a vector quantity all of these methods apply.

\begin{wex}{Finding the resultant force}
{A car (mass 1200 kg) applies a force of 2000 N on a trailer (mass 250 kg). A constant frictional force of 200 N is acting on the trailer, and a constant frictional force of 300 N is acting on the car.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a force diagram of all the forces acting on the car.
\item Draw a free body diagram of all the horizontal forces acting on the trailer. 
\item Use the force diagram to determine the resultant force on the trailer.
\end{enumerate}
}
{
\westep{Draw the force diagram for the car.}
The question asks us to draw all the forces on the car. This means that we must include horizontal and vertical forces.

To find the resultant force we need to add all the horizontal forces together. We do not add vertical forces as the movement of the car and trailer will be in a horizontal direction, and not up or down.
F$_{R}$ = 2000 + (-200) = 1800 N to the right.

\section{Newton's Laws}
In grade 10 you learned about motion, but did not look at how things start to move. You have also learned about forces. In this section we will look at the effect of forces on objects and how we can make things move. 

\subsection{Newton's First Law}
Sir Isaac Newton was a scientist who lived in England (1642-1727) who was interested in the motion of objects under various conditions. He suggested that a stationary object will remain stationary unless a force acts on it and that a moving object will continue moving unless a force slows it down, speeds it up or changes its direction of motion. From this he formulated what is known as Newton's First Law of Motion:

\Definition{Newton's First Law of Motion}{An object will remain in a state of rest or continue traveling at constant velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced (net) force. }

Let us consider the following situations:\\

An ice skater pushes herself away from the side of the ice rink and skates across the ice. She will continue to move in a straight line across the ice unless something stops her. Objects are also like that. If we kick a soccer ball across a soccer field, according to Newton's First Law, the soccer ball should keep on moving forever! However, in real life this does not happen. Is Newton's Law wrong? Not really. Newton's First Law applies to situations where there aren't any external forces present. This means that friction is not present. In the case of the ice skater, the friction between the skates and the ice is very little and she will continue moving for quite a distance. In the case of the soccer ball, air resistance (friction between the air and the ball) and friction between the grass and the ball is present and this will slow the ball down.

\subsubsection{Newton's First Law in action}
We experience Newton's First Law in every day life. Let us look at the following examples:\\

{\bf{Rockets}}:\\

A spaceship is launched into space. The force of the exploding gases pushes the rocket through the air into space. Once it is in space, the engines are switched off and it will keep on moving at a constant velocity. If the astronauts want to change the direction of the spaceship they need to fire an engine. This will then apply a force on the rocket and it will change its direction.

{\bf{Seat belts}:}\\

We wear seat belts in cars. This is to protect us when the car is involved in an accident. If a car is traveling at 120 \kph, the passengers in the car is also traveling at 120 \kph. When the car suddenly stops a force is exerted on the car (making it slow down), but not on the passengers. The passengers will carry on moving forward at 120 \kph according to Newton I. If they are wearing seat belts, the seat belts will stop them by exerting a force on them and so prevent them from getting hurt.

\begin{wex}{Newton's First Law in action}{Why do passengers get thrown to the side when the car they are driving in goes around a corner?}
{\westep{What happens before the car turns}
Before the car starts turning both the passengers and the car are traveling at the same velocity. (picture A)

\westep{What happens while the car turns}
The driver turns the wheels of the car, which then exert a force on the car and the car turns. This force acts on the car but not the passengers, hence (by Newton's First Law) the passengers continue moving with the same original velocity. (picture B)

\westep{Why passengers get thrown to the side?}
If the passengers are wearing seat belts they will exert a force on the passengers until the passengers' velocity is the same as that of the car (picture C). Without a seat belt the passenger may hit the side of the car.

\subsection{Newton's Second Law of Motion}
According to Newton I, things 'like to keep on doing what they are doing'. In other words, if an object is moving, it tends to continue moving (in a straight line and at the same speed) and if an object is stationary, it tends to remain stationary. So how do objects start moving?  

Let us look at the example of a 10 kg box on a rough table. If we push lightly on the box as indicated in the diagram, the box won't move. Let's say we applied a force of 100 N, yet the box remains stationary. At this point a frictional force of 100 N is acting on the box, preventing the box from moving. If we increase the force, let's say to 150 N and the box almost starts to move, the frictional force is 150 N. To be able to move the box, we need to push hard enough to overcome the friction and then move the box. If we therefore apply a force of 200 N remembering that a frictional force of 150 N is present, the 'first' 150 N will be used to overcome or 'cancel' the friction and the other 50 N will be used to move (accelerate) the block. In order to accelerate an object we must have a resultant force acting on the block. 

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-3,-1)(4,1)

\rput(0,0.5){box}
\uput[ur](-3,0){rough table}
\uput[r](1.5,0.5){applied force}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

Now, what do you think will happen if we pushed harder, lets say 300 N? Or, what do you think will happen if the mass of the block was more, say 20 kg, or what if it was less? Let us investigate how the motion of an object is affected by mass and force.

\begin{enumerate}
\item A constant force of 20 N, acting at an angle of 60$\degree$ to the horizontal, is applied to a dynamics trolley.
\item Ticker tape attached to the trolley runs through a ticker timer of frequency 20 Hz as the trolley is moving on the frictionless surface.
\item The above procedure is repeated 4 times, each time using the same force, but varying the mass of the trolley as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Case 1: 6,25~kg
\item Case 2: 3,57~kg
\item Case 3: 2,27~kg
\item Case 4: 1,67~kg
\end{itemize}
\item Shown below are sections of the four ticker tapes obtained. The tapes are marked with the letters A, B, C, D, etc. A is the first dot, B is the second dot and so on. The distance between each dot is also shown.

Instructions:\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use each tape to calculate the instantaneous velocity (in \ms) of the trolley at points B and F (remember to convert the distances to m first!). Use these velocities to calculate the trolley's acceleration in each case.
%\item Use Newton's second law to calculate the mass of the trolley in each case.
\item Tabulate the mass and corresponding acceleration values as calculated in each case. Ensure that each column and row in your table is appropriately labeled. 
\item Draw a graph of acceleration vs. mass, using a scale of 1 cm = 1 \mss on the y-axis and 1 cm = 1 kg on the x-axis.
\item Use your graph to read off the acceleration of the trolley if its mass is 5 kg.
\item Write down a conclusion for the experiment.
\end{enumerate}
}

You will have noted in the investigation above that the heavier the trolley is, the slower it moved. The acceleration is \textit{inversely} proportional to the mass. In mathematical terms: 
\begin{equation*}
a \propto frac{1}{m}
\end{equation*}

In a similar investigation where the mass is kept constant, but the applied force is varied, you will find that the bigger the force is, the faster the object will move. The acceleration of the trolley is therefore \textit{directly} proportional to the resultant force. In mathematical terms: 
\begin{equation*}
a \propto F.
\end{equation*}

Rearranging the above equations, we get $a$ $\propto$ $\frac{F}{m}$ OR $F~=~ma$\\

Newton formulated his second law as follows:\\

\Definition{Newton's Second Law of Motion}{
If a resultant force acts on a body, it will cause the body to accelerate in the direction of the resultant force. The acceleration of the body will be directly proportional to the resultant force and inversely proportional to the mass of the body. The mathematical representation is:
\begin{equation*}
 F = ma.
 \end{equation*}
}

\subsubsection{Applying Newton's Second Law}
Newton's Second Law can be applied to a variety of situations. We will look at the main types of examples that you need to study.

\westep{Calculate the frictional force}
To find the frictional force we will apply Newton's Second Law. We are given the mass (10 + 15 kg) and the acceleration (2 \mss). Choose the direction of motion to be the positive direction (to the right is positive).
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{R} = ma\\
F_{\rm{applied}}+ F_{f} = ma\\
500 + F_{f} = (10 + 15) (2)\\
F_{f} = 50 - 500\\
F_{f} = - 450 N\\
\end{eqnarray*}
The frictional force is 450 N opposite to the direction of motion (to the left).\\

\westep{Find the tension in the rope}
To find the tension in the rope we need to look at one of the two crates on their own. Let's choose the 10 kg crate. Firstly, we need to draw a force diagram:

\end{pspicture} 
}
\end{center}
\caption{Force diagram of 10 kg crate}
\end{figure}

The frictional force on the 10 kg block is one third of the total, therefore:\\
$F_{f} = \frac{1}{3} \times$ 450\\
$F_{f} = 150\ \rm{N}$\\

If we apply Newton's Second Law:\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{R} &=& ma\\
T + F_{f} &=& (10)(2)\\
T + (-150) &=& 20\\
T &=& 170\ \rm{N}
\end{eqnarray*}

Note: If we had used the same principle and applied it to 15 kg crate, our calculations would have been the following:\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{R} &=& ma\\
F_{\rm{applied}}+T + F_{f} &=& (15)(2)\\
500 + T + (-300) &=& 30\\
T &=& -170\ \rm{N}
\end{eqnarray*}
The negative answer here means that the force is in the direction opposite to the motion, in other words to the left, which is correct. However, the question asks for the magnitude of the force and your answer will be quoted as 170 N.

\subsubsection{Object on an inclined plane}
When we place an object on a slope the force of gravity (F$_{g}$) acts straight down and not perpendicular to the slope. Due to gravity pulling straight down, the object will tend to slide down the slope with a force equal to the horizontal component of the force of gravity (F$_{g}$~sin~$\theta$). The object will 'stick' to the slope due to the frictional force between the object and the surface. As you increase the angle of the slope, the horizontal component will also increase until the frictional force is overcome and the object starts to slide down the slope.

The force of gravity will also tend to push an object 'into' the slope. The vertical component of this force is equal to the vertical component of the force of gravity (F$_{g}$ cos $\theta$). There is no movement in this direction as this force is balanced by the slope pushing up against the object. This ``pushing force'' is called the normal force (N) and is equal to the force required to make the component of the resultant force perpendicularly into the plane zero, F$_{g}$ cos $\theta$ in this case, but opposite in direction.

\Tip{Do not use the abbreviation W for weight as it is used to abbreviate 'work'. Rather use the force of gravity F$_{g}$ for weight.}

{\westep{Find the magnitude of P}
We are usually asked to find the magnitude of T, but in this case T is given and we are asked to find P. We can use the same equation. T is the force that balances the component of P parallel to the plane (P$_x$) and therefore it has the same magnitude.\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
T &=& P~\rm{sin}~\theta\\
312 &=& P~\rm{sin}~35\degree\\
P &=& 544~\eN
\end{eqnarray*}
\westep{Find the magnitude of R}
R can also be determined with the use of trigonometric ratios. The tan or cos ratio can be used. We recommend that you use the tan ratio because it does not involve using the value for P (for in case you made a mistake in calculating P).
\begin{eqnarray*}
\rm{tan}~55\degree &=& \frac{R}{T}\\
\rm{tan}~55\degree &=& \frac{R}{312}\\
R &=& \rm{tan}~55\degree \times 312\\
R &=& 445,6~\eN\\
R &=& 446~\eN
\end{eqnarray*}
Note that the question asks that the answers be given to 3 significant figures. We therefore round 445,6 N up to 446 N.

\subsubsection{Lifts and rockets}
So far we have looked at objects being pulled or pushed across a surface, in other words motion parallel to the surface the object rests on. Here we only considered forces parallel to the surface, but we can also lift objects up or let them fall. This is vertical motion where only vertical forces are being considered.\\
\\
Let us consider a 500 kg lift, with no passengers, hanging on a cable. The purpose of the cable is to pull the lift upwards so that it can reach the next floor or to let go a little so that it can move downwards to the floor below. We will look at five possible stages during the motion of the lift.\\
%Drawing of lift with different stages

{\bf{Stage 1:}}\\ The 500 kg lift is stationary at the second floor of a tall building.\\
Because the lift is stationary (not moving) there is no resultant force acting on the lift. This means that the upward forces must be balanced by the downward forces. The only force acting down is the force of gravity which is equal to (500 x 9,8 = 4900 N) in this case. The cable must therefore pull upwards with a force of 4900 N to keep the lift stationary at this point.\\
\\
{\bf{Stage 2:}}\\ The lift moves upwards at an acceleration of 1 \mss.\\
If the lift is accelerating, it means that there is a resultant force in the direction of the motion. This means that the force acting upwards is now greater than the force of gravity F$_{g}$ (down). To find the magnitude of the force applied by the cable (F$_{c}$) we can do the following calculation: (Remember to choose a direction as positive. We have chosen upwards as positive.)\\

\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{R} &=& ma\\
F_{c}+ F_{g} &=& ma\\
F_{c}+ (-4900) &=& (500)(1)\\
F_{c} &=& 5400~\rm{N~upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

The answer makes sense as we need a bigger force upwards to cancel the effect of gravity as well as make the lift go faster.\\
\\
{\bf{Stage 3:}}\\ The lift moves at a constant velocity.\\
When the lift moves at a constant velocity, it means that all the forces are balanced and that there is no resultant force. The acceleration is zero, therefore F$_{R}$ = 0. The force acting upwards is equal to the force acting downwards, therefore F$_{c}$ = 4900 N.\\
\\
{\bf{Stage 4:}}\\ The lift slows down at a rate of 2\mss.\\
As the lift is now slowing down there is a resultant force downwards. This means that the force acting downwards is greater than the force acting upwards. To find the magnitude of the force applied by the cable (F$_{c}$) we can do the following calculation: Again we have chosen upwards as positive, which means that the acceleration will be a negative number.\\

\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{R} &=& ma\\
F_{c}+ F_{g} &=& ma\\
F_{c}+ (-4900) &=& (500)(-2)\\
F_{c} &=& 3900~\rm{N~upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

This makes sense as we need a smaller force upwards to ensure that the resultant force is downward. The force of gravity is now greater than the upward pull of the cable and the lift will slow down.\\
\\
{\bf{Stage 5:}}\\ The cable snaps.\\
When the cable snaps, the force that used to be acting upwards is no longer present. The only force that is present would be the force of gravity. The lift will freefall and its acceleration can be calculated as follows: 

\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{R} &=& ma\\
F_{c}+ F_{g} &=& ma\\
0 + (-4900) &=& (500)(a)\\
a &=& -9,8 \emss\\
a &=& 9,8 \emss \rm{downwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsubsection{Rockets}
As with lifts, rockets are also examples of objects in vertical motion. The force of gravity pulls the rocket down while the thrust of the engine pushes the rocket upwards. The force that the engine exerts must overcome the force of gravity so that the rocket can accelerate upwards. The worked example below looks at the application of Newton's Second Law in launching a rocket. 

\begin{wex}{Newton II - rocket}
{A rocket is launched vertically upwards into the sky at an acceleration of 20 \mss. If the mass of the rocket is 5000 kg, calculate the magnitude and direction of the thrust of the rocket's engines.
%picture of rocket
}
{\westep{Analyse what is given and what is asked}
We have the following:\\
m = 5000 kg\\
a = 20 \mss\\
F$_{g}$ = 5000 x 9,8 = 49000 N\\
We are asked to find the thrust of the rocket engine F$_{1}$.\\

\westep{Find the thrust of the engine}
We will apply Newton's Second Law:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{R} &=& ma\\
F_{1}+ F_{g} &=& ma\\
F_{1} + (-49000) &=& (5000)(20)\\
F_{1} &=& 149~000~\rm{N~upwards}\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection{Newton's Third Law of Motion}
Newton's Third Law of Motion deals with the interaction between pairs of objects. For example, if you hold a book up against a wall you are exerting a force on the book (to keep it there) and the book is exerting a force back at you (to keep you from falling through the book). This may sound strange, but if the book was not pushing back at you, your hand would push through the book! These two forces (the force of the hand on the book (F$_{1}$) and the force of the book on the hand (F$_{2}$)) are called an action-reaction pair of forces. They have the same magnitude, but act in opposite directions and act on different objects (the one force is onto the book and the other is onto your hand). \\

There is another action-reaction pair of forces present in this situation. The book is pushing against the wall (action force) and the wall is pushing back at the book (reaction). The force of the book on the wall (F$_{3}$) and the force of the wall on the book (F$_{4}$) are shown in the diagram.

\Definition{Newton's Third Law of Motion}
{If body A exerts a force on body B, then body B exerts a force of equal magnitude on body A, but in the opposite direction.}

Newton's action-reaction pairs can be found everywhere in life where two objects interact with one another. The following worked examples will illustrate this:

{\westep{Draw a force diagram}
Start by drawing the picture. You will be using arrows to indicate the forces so make your picture large enough so that detailed labels can also be added. The picture needs to be accurate, but not artistic! Use stickmen if you have to.

\westep{Label the diagram}
Take one pair at a time and label them carefully. If there is not enough space on the drawing, then use a key on the side.

In this question statements are made about the force of the floor (lift) on Tammy's feet. This force corresponds to F$_{2}$ in our diagram. The reaction force that pairs up with this one is F$_{1}$, which is the force that Tammy's feet exerts on the floor of the lift. The magnitude of these two forces are the same, but they act in opposite directions.\\
\westep{Choose the correct answer}
It is important to analyse the question first, before looking at the answers as the answers might confuse you. Make sure that you understand the situation and know what is asked before you look at the options.\\
The correct answer is B.\\

Note that we had to draw all the forces acting on the book and not the action-reaction pairs. None of the forces drawn are action-reaction pairs, because they all act on the same object (the book). When you label forces, be as specific as possible, including the direction of the force and both objects involved, for example, do not say gravity (which is an incomplete answer) but rather say 'Downward (direction) gravitational force of the Earth (object) on the book (object)'. \\
\westep{State Newton's Third Law}
If body A exerts a force onto body B, then body B will exert a force equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction, onto body A.\\
\westep{Name the action-reaction pairs}
The question only asks for action-reaction forces in the horizontal plane. Therefore:\\
Pair 1: Action: Applied force of the girl on the book; Reaction: The force of the book on the girl.\\
Pair 2: Action: Force of the book on the wall; Reaction: Force of the wall on the book.\\
Note that a Newton III pair will always involve the same combination of words, like 'book on wall' and 'wall on book'. The objects are 'swapped around' in naming the pairs.\\

\item{a stopwatch - optional (a cell phone can also be used)}
\item{a measuring tape - optional}
\end{enumerate}}
\Method{
\begin{enumerate}
\item Divide into groups of at least five.
\item Attach one end of the fishing line to the blackboard with tape. Have one teammate hold the other end of the fishing line so that it is taut and roughly horizontal. The line must be held steady and \textbf{must not} be moved up or down during the experiment.
\item Have one teammate blow up a balloon and hold it shut with his or her fingers. Have another teammate tape the straw along the side of the balloon. Thread the fishing line through the straw and hold the balloon at the far end of the line.
\item Let go of the rocket and observe how the rocket moves forward.
\item{Optionally, the rockets of each group can be timed to determine a winner of the fastest rocket.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Assign one teammate to time the event. The balloon should be let go when the time keeper yells ``Go!'' Observe how your rocket moves toward the blackboard.
\item Have another teammate stand right next to the blackboard and yell ``Stop!'' when the rocket hits its target. If the balloon does not make it all the way to the blackboard, ``Stop!'' should be called when the balloon stops moving. The timekeeper should record the flight time.
\item Measure the exact distance the rocket traveled. Calculate the average speed at which the balloon traveled. To do this, divide the distance traveled by the time the balloon was ``in flight.'' Fill in your results for Trial 1 in the Table below.
\item Each team should conduct two more races and complete the sections in the Table for Trials 2 and 3. Then calculate the average speed for the three trials to determine your team's race entry time.
\end{enumerate}

While doing the experiment, you should think about,
\begin{enumerate}
\item{What made your rocket move?}
\item{How is Newton's Third Law of Motion demonstrated by this activity?}
\item{Draw pictures using labeled arrows to show the forces acting on the inside of the balloon before it was released and after it was released.}
\end{enumerate}}

\subsection{Different types of forces}

\subsubsection{Tension}
Tension is the magnitude of the force that exists in objects like ropes, chains and struts that are providing support. For example, there are tension forces in the ropes supporting a child's swing hanging from a tree.

\subsubsection{Contact and non-contact forces}
In this chapter we have come across a number of different types of forces, for example a push or a pull, tension in a string, frictional forces and the normal force. These are all examples of contact forces where there is a physical point of contact between applying the force and the object. Non-contact forces are forces that act over a distance, for example magnetic forces, electrostatic forces and gravitational forces.\\
\\
When an object is placed on a surface, two types of surface forces can be identified. Friction is a force that acts between the surface and the object and is parallel to the surface. The normal force is a force that acts between the object and the surface and is perpendicular to the surface.\\

\subsubsection{The normal force}
A 5 kg box is placed on a rough surface and a 10 N force is applied at an angle of 36,9$\degree$ to the horizontal. The box does not move. The normal force (N or F$_N$) is the force between the box and the surface acting in the vertical direction. If this force is not present the box would fall through the surface because the force of gravity pulls it downwards. The normal force therefore acts upwards. We can calculate the normal force by considering all the forces in the vertical direction. All the forces in the vertical direction must add up to zero because there is no movement in the vertical direction.
\begin{eqnarray*}
N + F_y + F_g &=& 0\\
N + 6 + (-49) &=& 0\\
N &=& 43 \eN~ \mbox{upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

The most interesting and illustrative normal force question, that is often asked, has to do with a scale in a lift. Using Newton's third law we can solve these problems quite easily.

When you stand on a scale to measure your weight you are pulled down by gravity. There is no acceleration downwards because there is a reaction force we call the normal force acting upwards on you. This is the force that the scale would measure. If the gravitational force were less then the reading on the scale would be less.

\begin{wex}{Normal Forces 1}{A man with a mass of 100~kg stands on a scale
(measuring newtons). What is the reading on the scale?}

{\westep{Identify what information is given and what is asked for} We are given the mass of the man. We know the gravitational acceleration that acts on him is 9,8~=~\mss .

\westep{Decide what equation to use to solve the problem}
The scale measures the normal force on the man. This is the force that
balances gravity. We can use Newton's laws to solve the problem:
\begin{equation*}
F_r=F_g+F_N
\end{equation*}
where $F_r$ is the resultant force on the man.

\westep {Firstly we determine the force on the man due to gravity}
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_g&=&mg \\
&=& (100\ekg)(9,8\emss)\\
&=& 980\ \mathrm{kg\cdot\emss} \\
&=& 980\eN\ \mathrm{downwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Now determine the normal force acting upwards on the man}
We now know the gravitational force downwards. We know that the sum of all the forces must equal the resultant acceleration times the mass. The overall resultant acceleration of the man on the scale is $0$ - so $F_r=0$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_r&=&F_g+F_N \\
0 &=& -980\eN+F_N\\
F_N &=& 980\eN\ \mathrm{upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Quote the final answer}
The normal force is 980~N upwards. It exactly balances the gravitational force downwards so there is no net force and no acceleration on the man. The reading on the scale is 980 N.}
\end{wex}

Now we are going to add things to exactly the same problem to show how things change slightly. We will now move to a lift moving at constant velocity. Remember if velocity is constant then acceleration is zero.

\begin{wex}{Normal Forces 2}{A man with a mass of 100~kg stands on a scale (measuring newtons) inside a lift that is moving downwards at a constant velocity of 2 \ms. What is the reading on the scale?}
{\westep{Identify what information is given and what is asked for}
We are given the mass of the man and the acceleration of the lift. We know the gravitational acceleration that acts on him.

\westep{Decide which equation to use to solve the problem}
Once again we can use Newton's laws. We know that the sum of all the forces must equal the resultant force, $F_r$.
\begin{equation*}
F_r=F_g+F_N
\end{equation*}

\westep{Determine the force due to gravity}
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_g&=&mg \\
&=& (100\ekg)(9,8\emss)\\
&=& 980\ \mathrm{kg\cdot\emss} \\
&=& 980\eN\ \mathrm{downwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Now determine the normal force acting upwards on the man}
The scale measures this normal force, so once we have determined it we will know the reading on the scale. Because the lift is moving at constant velocity the overall resultant acceleration of the man on the scale is $0$. If we write out the equation:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_r&=&F_g+F_N \\
ma&=&F_g+F_N \\
(100)(0) &=& -980\eN +F_N\\
F_N = 980\eN\ \mathrm{upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Quote the final answer}
The normal force is 980~N upwards. It exactly balances the gravitational force downwards so there is no net force and no acceleration on the man. The reading on the scale is 980 N.}
\end{wex}

In the previous two examples we got exactly the same result because the net acceleration on the man was zero! If the lift is accelerating downwards things are slightly different and now we will get a more interesting answer!

\begin{wex}{Normal Forces 3}{A man with a mass of 100~kg stands on a scale (measuring newtons) inside a lift that is accelerating downwards at 2 \mss. What is the reading on the scale?}
{\westep{Identify what information is given and what is asked for}
We are given the mass of the man and his resultant acceleration - this is just the acceleration of the lift. We know the gravitational acceleration also acts on him.

\westep{Decide which equation to use to solve the problem}
Once again we can use Newton's laws. We know that the sum of all the forces must equal the resultant force, $F_r$.
\begin{equation*}
F_r=F_g+F_N
\end{equation*}

\westep{Determine the force due to gravity, $F_g$}
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_g&=&mg \\
&=& (100\ekg)(9,8\emss)\\
&=& 980\ \mathrm{kg\cdot\emss} \\
&=& 980\eN\ \mathrm{downwards}
\end{eqnarray*}
\westep{Determine the resultant force, $F_r$}
The resultant force can be calculated by applying Newton's Second Law:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_r &=& ma\\
F_r &=& (100\ekg)(-2\emss)\\
&=& -200~N\\
&=& 200~N~\mbox{down}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Determine the normal force, $F_N$}
The sum of all the vertical forces is equal to the resultant force, therefore
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_r&=&F_g + F_N \\
-200\eN &=& -980\eN + F_N\\
F_N &=& 780\eN\ \mathrm{upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Quote the final answer}
The normal force is 780~N upwards. It balances the gravitational force downwards just enough so that the man only accelerates downwards at 2~\mss. The reading on the scale is 780 N.}
\end{wex}

\begin{wex}{Normal Forces 4}{A man with a mass of 100~kg stands on a scale (measuring newtons) inside a lift that is accelerating upwards at 4 \mss. What is the reading on the scale?}
{\westep{Identify what information is given and what is asked for}
We are given the mass of the man and his resultant acceleration - this is just the acceleration of the lift. We know the gravitational acceleration also acts on him.

\westep{Decide which equation to use to solve the problem}
Once again we can use Newton's laws. We know that the sum of all the forces must equal the resultant force, $F_r$.

\begin{equation*}
F_r=F_g+F_N
\end{equation*}

\westep{Determine the force due to gravity, $F_g$}
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_g&=&mg \\
&=& (100\ekg)(9,8\emss)\\
&=& 980\ \mathrm{kg}\cdot\emss \\
&=& 980\eN\ \mathrm{downwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Determine the resultant force, $F_r$}
The resultant force can be calculated by applying Newton's Second Law:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_r &=& ma\\
F_r &=& (100\ekg)(4\emss)\\
&=& 400~N~\mbox{upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Determine the normal force, $F_N$}
The sum of all the vertical forces is equal to the resultant force, therefore
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_r&=&F_g + F_N \\
400\eN &=& -980\eN + F_N\\
F_N &=& 1380\eN\ \mathrm{upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Quote the final answer}
The normal force is 1380~N upwards. It balances the gravitational force downwards and then in addition applies sufficient force to accelerate the man upwards at 4\mss.  The reading on the scale is 1380 N.}
\end{wex}



\subsubsection{Friction forces}
When the surface of one object slides over the surface of another, each body exerts a frictional force on the other. For example if a book slides across a table, the table exerts a frictional force onto the book and the book exerts a frictional force onto the table (Newton's Third Law). Frictional forces act parallel to surfaces.\\

A force is not always powerful enough to make an object move, for example a small applied force might not be able to move a heavy crate. The frictional force opposing the motion of the crate is equal to the applied force but acting in the opposite direction. This frictional force is called \emph{static friction}. When we increase the applied force (push harder), the frictional force will also increase until the applied force overcomes it. This frictional force can vary from zero (when no other forces are present and the object is stationary) to a maximum that depends on the surfaces. When the applied force is greater than the maximum frictional force, the crate will move. Once the object moves, the frictional force will decrease and remain at that level, which is also dependent on the surfaces, while the objects are moving. This is called \emph{kinetic friction}. In both cases the maximum frictional force is related to the normal force and can be calculated as follows:\\
\\
For static friction: F$_f$ $\leq$ $\mu_s$ N\\
\\
Where $\mu_s$ = the coefficient of static friction\\
and N = normal force\\
\\
For kinetic friction: F$_f$ = $\mu_k$ N\\
\\
Where $\mu_k$ = the coefficient of kinetic friction\\
and N = normal force\\
\\
Remember that static friction is present when the object is not moving and kinetic friction while the object is moving. For example when you drive at constant velocity in a car on a tar road you have to keep the accelerator pushed in slightly to overcome the friction between the tar road and the wheels of the car. However, while moving at a constant velocity the wheels of the car are rolling, so this is not a case of two surfaces ``rubbing'' against eachother and we are in fact looking at static friction. If you should break hard, causing the car to skid to a halt, we would be dealing with two surfaces rubbing against eachother and hence kinetic friction. The higher the value for the coefficient of friction, the more 'sticky' the surface is and the lower the value, the more 'slippery' the surface is.\\

The frictional force (F$_f$) acts in the horizontal direction and can be calculated in a similar way to the normal for as long as there is no movement. If we use the same example as in figure \ref{friction and normal} and we choose to the rightward direction as positive,
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_f + F_x &=& 0\\
F_f + (+8) &=& 0\\
F_f &=& -8 \\
F_f &=& 8 \eN~ \mbox{to the left}
\end{eqnarray*}

The normal force acts perpendicular to the surface (and not vertically upwards). It's magnitude is equal to the component of the weight perpendicular to the slope. Therefore:
\begin{eqnarray*}
N &=& F_g~cos~30\degree\\
N &=& 490~cos~30\degree\\
N &=& 224 \eN~\mbox{perpendicular to the surface}
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
F_f &=& F_g~sin~30\degree\\
F_f &=& 490~sin~30\degree\\
F_f &=& 245 \eN~\mbox{up the slope}

We often think about friction in a negative way but very often friction is useful without us realizing it. If there was no friction and you tried to prop a ladder up against a wall, it would simply slide to the ground. Rock climbers use friction to maintain their grip on cliffs. The brakes of cars would be useless if it wasn't for friction!

\begin{wex}{Coefficients of friction}{A block of wood weighing 32 N is placed on a rough, flat inclline and a rope is tied to it. The tension in the rope can be increased to 8 N before the block starts to slide. A force of 4 N will keep the block moving at constant speed once it has been set in motion. Determine the coefficients of static and kinetic friction.}
{\westep{Analyse the question and determine what is asked}
The weight of the block is given (32 N) and two situations are identified: One where the block is not moving (applied force is 8 N), and one where the block is moving (applied force is 4 N). \\
We are asked to find the coefficient for static friction $\mu_s$ and kinetic friction $\mu_k$.\\
\westep{Find the coefficient of static friction}
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_f &=& \mu_s N\\
8 &=& \mu_s (32)\\
\mu_s &=& 0,25
\end{eqnarray*}
Note that the coefficient of friction does not have a unit as it shows a ratio. The value for the coefficient of friction friction can have any value up to a maximum of 0,25. When a force less than 8 N is applied, the coefficient of friction will be less than 0,25.\\

\westep{Find the coefficient of kinetic friction}
The coefficient of kinetic friction is sometimes also called the coefficient of dynamic friction. Here we look at when the block is moving:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_f &=& \mu_k N\\
4 &=& \mu_k (32)\\
\mu_k &=& 0,125
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection{Forces in equilibrium}
At the beginning of this chapter it was mentioned that resultant forces cause objects to accelerate in a straight line. If an object is stationary or moving at constant velocity then either,
\begin{itemize}
\item{no forces are acting on the object, or}
\item{the forces acting on that object are exactly balanced.}
\end{itemize}
In other words, for stationary objects or objects moving with constant velocity, the resultant force acting on the object is zero. Additionally, if there is a perpendicular moment of force, then the object will rotate. You will learn more about moments of force later in this chapter.

Therefore, in order for an object not to move or to be in \textit{equilibrium}, the sum of the forces (resultant force) must be zero and the sum of the moments of force must be zero.

\Definition{Equilibrium}{An object in equilibrium has both the sum of the forces acting on it and the sum of the moments of the forces equal to zero.}

If a resultant force acts on an object then that object can be brought into equilibrium by applying an additional force that exactly balances this resultant. Such a force is called the {\em equilibrant} and is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the original resultant force acting on the object.

\Definition{Equilibrant}{The equilibrant of any number of forces is the single force required to produce equilibrium, and is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the resultant force.}

In the figure the resultant of $F_1$ and $F_2$ is shown. The equilibrant of $F_1$ and $F_2$ is then the vector opposite in direction to this resultant with the same magnitude (i.e. $F_3$).

\item{ $F_3$ is the equilibrant of $F_1$ and

As an example of an object in equilibrium, consider an object held stationary by two ropes in the arrangement below:

Let us draw a free body diagram for the object. In the free body diagram the
object is drawn as a dot and all forces acting on the object are drawn in the correct directions starting from that dot. In this case, three forces are acting on the object.

Each rope exerts a force on the object in the direction of the rope away from the object. These tension forces are represented by $T_1$ and $T_2$. Since the object has mass, it is attracted towards the centre of the Earth. This weight is represented in the force diagram as $F_g$.

Since the object is stationary, the resultant force acting on the object is zero. In other words the three force vectors drawn tail-to-head form a closed triangle:

\item Determine the tension in the chain initially.
\item Draw a free body diagram representing the forces acting on the engine
in the final situation.
\item Determine the magnitude of the applied force and the tension in the chain in the final situations.

\end{enumerate}}
{\westep{Initial free body diagram for the engine}
There are only two forces acting on the engine initially: the tension in the chain, $T_{chain}$ and the weight of the engine, $F_g$.

\begin{pspicture}(-1,-2)(1,2)

\rput(-0.6,1){$T_{chain}$}
\rput(-0.4,-1){$F_g$}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}
\westep{Determine the tension in the chain}
The engine is initially stationary, which means that the resultant force on
the engine is zero. There are also no moments of force. Thus the tension in the chain exactly balances the weight of the engine. The tension in the chain is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
T_{chain} &=& F_g\\
&=& 2000\eN
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Final free body diagram for the engine}
There are three forces acting on the engine finally: The tension in the chain, the applied force and the weight of the engine.

\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

\westep{Calculate the magnitude of the applied force and the tension in the chain in the final situation}
Since no method was specified let us calculate the magnitudes algebraically. Since the triangle formed by the three forces is a right-angle triangle this is easily done:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{F_{applied}}{F_g} &=& \tan30^{\circ}\\
F_{applied} &=& (2000\eN)\tan30^{\circ}\\
&=& 1\,155\eN
\end{eqnarray*}
and
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{T_{chain}}{F_g} &=& \frac{1}{\cos30^{\circ}}\\
T_{chain} &=& \frac{2000\eN}{\cos30^{\circ}}\\
&=& 2\,309\eN
\end{eqnarray*}}

\section{Forces between Masses}

In Grade 10, you saw that gravitational fields exert forces on masses in the field. A field is a region of space in which an object experiences a force. The strength of a field is defined by a field strength. For example, the gravitational field strength, $g$, on or near the surface of the Earth has a value that is approximately 9,8 \mss.

The force exerted by a field of strength $g$ on an object of mass $m$ is given by:
\equ{F=m\cdot g}{eq:p:m:fmi11:weight}
This can be re-written in terms of $g$ as:
\nequ{g=\frac{F}{m}}
This means that $g$ can be understood to be a measure of force exerted per unit mass.

The force defined in Equation~\ref{eq:p:m:fmi11:weight} is known as weight.

Objects in a gravitational field exert forces on each other without touching. The gravitational force is an example of a non-contact force.

Gravity is a force and therefore must be described by a vector - so remember thta gravity has both magnitude and direction.

%\pagebreak[4]
\subsection{Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation}

\Definition{Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation}{Every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force directed along the line connecting the two. This force is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.}

The magnitude of the attractive gravitational force between the two point masses, $F$ is given by:
\equ{F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}}{eq:newtongravitation}
where:
$G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ is the mass of the first point mass, $m_2$ is the mass of the second point mass and $r$ is the distance between the two point masses.

Assuming SI units, $F$ is measured in newtons (N), $m_1$ and $m_2$ in kilograms (kg), $r$ in meters (m), and the constant $G$ is approximately equal to $6,67 \times 10^{-11} N\cdot m^2\cdot~kg^{-2}$. Remember that this is a force of attraction.

For example, consider a man of mass 80~kg standing 10 m from a woman with a mass of 65~kg. The attractive gravitational force between them would be:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F &=& G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\\
&=& (6,67 \times 10^{-11}\eN\cdot m^2\cdot~kg^{-2})(\frac{(80 kg)(65 kg)}{(10 m)^2})\\
&=&3,47 \times 10^{-9}\eN
\end{eqnarray*}
If the man and woman move to 1 m apart, then the force is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F &=& G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\\
&=& (6,67 \times 10^{-11}\eN\cdot m^2\cdot~kg^{-2})(\frac{(80 kg)(65 kg)}{(1 m)^2})\\
&=&3,47 \times 10^{-7}\eN
\end{eqnarray*}

As you can see, these forces are very small.

Now consider the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon. The mass of the Earth is $5,98\times 10^{24}$~kg, the mass of the Moon is $7,35\times 10^{22}$~kg and the Earth and Moon are $3,8 \times 10^{8}$~m apart. The gravitational force between the Earth and Moon is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F &=& G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\\
&=& (6,67 \times 10^{-11}\eN\cdot m^2\cdot~kg^{-2})(\frac{(5,98\times 10^{24} kg)(7,35\times 10^{22} kg)}{(0,38 \times 10^{9} m)^2})\\
&=&2,03\times 10^{20}\eN
\end{eqnarray*}

From this example you can see that the force is very large.

These two examples demonstrate that the greater the masses, the greater the force between them. The $1/r^2$ factor tells us that the distance between the two bodies plays a role as well. The closer two bodies are, the
stronger the gravitational force between them is. We feel the gravitational attraction of the Earth most at the surface since that is the closest we can get to it, but if we were in outer-space, we would barely feel the effect of the Earth's gravity!

Remember that
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_Fma_again}
F=m\cdot a
\end{equation}
which means that every object on Earth feels the same gravitational acceleration! That means whether you drop a pen or a book (from the same height), they will both take the same length of time to hit the ground... in fact they will be head to head for the entire fall if you drop them at the
same time. We can show this easily by using the two equations above (Equations~\ref{eq:newtongravitation} and \ref{eqn_Fma_again}). The force between the Earth (which has the mass $m_e$) and an object of mass $m_o$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_gravex1_1}
F=\frac{G m_o m_e}{r^2}
\end{equation}
and the acceleration of an object of mass $m_o$ (in terms of the force acting on it) is
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_gravex1_2}
a_o=\frac{F}{m_o}
\end{equation}
So we substitute equation (\ref{eqn_gravex1_1}) into Equation~(\ref{eqn_gravex1_2}), and we find that
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_gravex1_3}
a_o=\frac{G m_e}{r^2}
\end{equation}
Since it doesn't matter what $m_o$ is, this tells us that the acceleration on a body (due to the Earth's gravity) does not depend on the mass of the body. Thus all objects experience the same gravitational acceleration. The force on different bodies will be different but the acceleration will be the same. Due to the fact that this acceleration caused by gravity is the same on all objects we label it differently, instead of using $a$ we use $g$ which we call the gravitational acceleration.

\subsection{Comparative Problems}
Comparative problems involve calculation of something in terms of something else that we know. For example, if you weigh 490 N on Earth and the gravitational acceleration on Venus is 0,903 that of the gravitational acceleration on the Earth, then you would weigh 0,903~x~490~N~=~442,5~N on Venus.

%Falling Bodies - left out here as it is done in grade 12.

%Badly written - rewrite!! Not in syllabus
%\Extension{Terminal Velocity}{Physics is all about being simple - all we do is look at the world around us and notice how it really works. It is the one thing everyone is qualified to do - we spend most of our time when we are really young experimenting to find out how things work.

%Take a book - wave it in the air - change the angle and direction. what happens of course there is resistance. different angles make it greater - the faster the book moves the greater it is. The bigger the area of the book moving in the direction of motion the greater the force.

%So we know that air resistance exists! it is a force. So what happens when an object falls? of course there is air resistance - or drag as it is normally called. There is an approximate formula for the drag force as well. The important thing to realise is that when the drag force and the gravitational force are equal for a falling body there is no net force acting on it - which means no net acceleration. That does not mean it does not move - but it means that its speed does not change.

%It falls at a constant velocity! This velocity is called terminal velocity.}

%Not in syllabus - too little said here, must write much more or leave out.
%\Extension{Drag force}{The actual force of air resistance is quite complicated. Experiment by moving a book through the air with the face of the book and then the side of the book forward, you will agree that the area of the book makes a difference as to how much you must work in order to move the book at the same speed in both cases. This is why racing cars are slim-lined in design, and not shaped like a big box!

%Get a plastic container lid (or anything waterproof) swing it around in air and then try to swing it around under water. The density of the water is much larger than the air, making you have to work harder at swinging the lid in water. This is why boats and submarines are a lot slower than aeroplanes! So we know that density, area and speed all play a role in the drag force. The expression we use for drag force is \begin{equation} D=\frac{1}{2}C\rho Av^2 \end{equation} where $C$ is a constant which depends on the object and fluid interactions, $\rho$ is the density, $A$ is the area and $v$ is the velocity.}

\section{Momentum and Impulse}

Momentum is a physical quantity which is closely related to forces. Momentum is a property which applies to moving objects.

\Definition{Momentum}{Momentum is the tendency of an object to continue to move in its direction of travel. Momentum is calculated from the product of the mass and velocity of an object.}

The momentum (symbol $p$) of an object of mass $m$ moving at velocity $v$ is:
\nequ{p=m \cdot v}

According to this equation, momentum is related to both the mass and velocity of an object. A small car travelling at the same velocity as a big truck will have a smaller momentum than the truck. The smaller the mass, the smaller the velocity.\\
 A car travelling at 120~\kph will have a bigger momentum than the same car travelling at 60 \kph. Momentum is also related to velocity; the smaller the velocity, the smaller the momentum.\\
Different objects can also have the same momentum, for example a car travelling slowly can have the same momentum as a motor cycle travelling relatively fast. We can easily demonstrate this. Consider a car of mass 1~000~kg with a velocity of 8 \ms (about 30 \kph). The momentum of the car is therefore
\begin{eqnarray*}
p&=&m \cdot v\\
&=& (1000 \ekg)(8 \ems)\\
&=& 8000 \ekg\cdot\ems
\end{eqnarray*}

Now consider a motor cycle of mass 250~kg travelling at 32 \ms\ (about 115 \kph). The momentum of the motor cycle is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p&=&m \cdot v\\
&=& (250 \ekg)(32 \ems)\\
&=& 8000 \ekg \cdot \ems
\end{eqnarray*}

Even though the motor cycle is considerably lighter than the car, the fact that the motor cycle is travelling much faster than the car means that the momentum of both vehicles is the same.\\
\\
From the calculations above, you are able to derive the unit for momentum as kg$\cdot$\ms.\\
Momentum is also vector quantity, because it is the product of a scalar ($m$) with a vector ($v$).\\This means that whenever we calculate the momentum of an object, we need to include the direction of the momentum.

\begin{wex}{Momentum of a Soccer Ball}{A soccer ball of mass 420 g is kicked at 20 \ms\ towards the goal post. Calculate the momentum of the ball.}{
\westep{Identify what information is given and what is asked for}
The question explicitly gives
\begin{itemize}
\item the mass of the ball, and
\item the velocity of the ball
\end{itemize}
The mass of the ball must be converted to SI units.

\nequ{420\ \mathrm{g}=0,42\ekg}

We are asked to calculate the momentum of the ball. From the definition of momentum,
\nequ{p=m\cdot v}
we see that we need the mass and velocity of the ball, which we are given.

\westep{Do the calculation}
We calculate the magnitude of the momentum of the ball,
\begin{eqnarray*}
p&=& m \cdot v \\
&=& (0,42 \ekg)(20 \ems)\\
&=& 8,4\ekg \cdot \ems
\end{eqnarray*}
\westep{Quote the final answer}
We quote the answer with the direction of motion included,
$p$ = 8,4~kg$\cdot$\ms\ in the direction of the goal post.}
\end{wex}

\begin{wex}{Momentum of a cricket ball}{A cricket ball of mass 160 g is bowled at 40 \ms\ towards a batsman. Calculate the momentum of the cricket ball.}{\westep{Identify what information is given and what is asked for}
The question explicitly gives
\begin{itemize}
\item the mass of the ball ($m$ = 160 g = 0,16 kg), and
\item the velocity of the ball ($v$ = 40 \ms)
\end{itemize}
To calculate the momentum we will use \nequ{p = m\cdot v}.

\westep{Do the calculation}
\begin{eqnarray*}
p&=& m \cdot v \\
&=& (0,16 \ekg)(40 \ems)\\
&=& 6,4\ekg \cdot \ems \\
&=& 6,4\ekg \cdot \ems \mbox{in the direction of the batsman}
\end{eqnarray*}
}
\end{wex}

\begin{wex}{Momentum of the Moon}{The Moon is 384~400 km away from the Earth and orbits the Earth in 27,3 days. If the Moon has a mass of 7,35 x 10$^{22}$kg, what is the magnitude of its momentum if we assume a circular orbit?}{\westep{Identify what information is given and what is asked for} The question explicitly gives
\begin{itemize}
\item the mass of the Moon (m = 7,35 x 10$^{22}$ kg)
\item the distance to the Moon (384 400 km = 384 400 000 m = 3,844 x 10$^8$ m)
\item the time for one orbit of the Moon (27,3 days = 27,3 x 24 x 60 x 60 = 2,36 x 10$^6$ s)
\end{itemize}

We are asked to calculate only the magnitude of the momentum of the Moon (i.e. we do not need to specify a direction). In order to do this we require the mass and the magnitude of the velocity of the Moon, since
\nequ{p = m \cdot v}

\westep{Find the magnitude of the velocity of the Moon}
The magnitude of the average velocity is the same as the speed. Therefore:
\nequ{s = \frac{d}{\Delta t}}

We are given the time the Moon takes for one orbit but not how far it travels in that time. However, we can work this out from the distance to the Moon and the fact that the Moon has a circular orbit. Using the equation for the circumference, $C$, of a circle in terms of its radius, we can determine the distance travelled by the Moon in one
orbit:
\begin{eqnarray*}
C&=&2\pi r\\
&=&2\pi (3,844\times10^8 \mathrm{m})\\
&=& 2,42\times10^{9}\ \mathrm{m}
\end{eqnarray*}

Combining the distance travelled by the Moon in an orbit and the time
taken by the Moon to complete one orbit, we can determine the
magnitude of the Moon's velocity or speed,
\begin{eqnarray*}
s &=& \frac{d}{\Delta t}\\
&=& \frac{C}{T}\\
&=& \frac{2,42 \times 10^9 m}{2,36 \times 10^6 s}\\
&=& 1,02\times 10^{3}\ems.
\end{eqnarray*}
\westep{Finally calculate the momentum and quote the answer}
The magnitude of the Moon's momentum is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p &=& m \cdot v\\
&=& (7,35\times 10^{22} \ekg)(1,02\times 10^{3} \ems)\\
&=& 7,50 \times 10^{25}\ekg \cdot \ems
\end{eqnarray*}}
\end{wex}

\subsection{Vector Nature of Momentum}
As we have said, momentum is a vector quantity. Since momentum is a vector, the techniques of vector addition discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:vectors} must be used to calculate the total momentum of a system.

\begin{wex}{Calculating the Total Momentum of a System}{Two billiard balls roll towards each other. They each have a mass of 0,3~kg. Ball 1 is moving at $v_1=1\ems$ to the right, while ball 2 is moving at $v_2=0,8\ems$ to the left. Calculate the total momentum of the system.}{
\westep{Identify what information is given and what is asked for} The question
explicitly gives
\begin{itemize}
\item the mass of each ball,
\item the velocity of ball 1, $v_1$, and
\item the velocity of ball 2, $v_2$,
\end{itemize}
all in the correct units!

We are asked to calculate the {\bf total momentum of
the system}. In this example our system consists of two balls. To find
the total momentum we must determine the momentum of each ball and add them.

\nequ{p_{total} = p_1 + p_2}

Since ball 1 is moving to the right, its momentum is in this direction,
while the second ball's momentum is directed towards the left.

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-3,-1)(3,1)%\psgrid
\psline{-}(-2.8,-0.5)(2.8,-0.5)
\pscircle(-2,0.){0.5}
\psline{->}(-1.5,0.)(-0.5,0.)
\rput(-1,-0.25){$v_1$}
\rput(-2,0.){$m_1$}
\pscircle(2,0.){0.5}
\psline{->}(1.5,0)(0.7,0.)
\rput(1.1,-0.25){$v_2$}
\rput(2,0.){$m_2$}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

Thus, we are required to find the sum of two vectors acting along the
same straight line. The algebraic method of vector addition introduced
in Chapter~\ref{chap:vectors} can thus be used.\\

\westep{Choose a frame of reference} Let us choose right as the
positive direction, then obviously left is negative.\\

\westep{Calculate the momentum} The total momentum of the system is then the sum of the two momenta taking the
directions of the velocities into account. Ball 1 is travelling
at 1 \ms to the right or +1 \ms. Ball 2 is travelling at 0,8 \ms to the left or -0,8 \ms. Thus,
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{total} &=& m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2\\
&=& (0,3 \ekg)(+1 \ems) + (0,3 \ekg)(-0,8 \ems)\\
&=& (+0,3 \ekg\cdot\ems) + (-0,24 \ekg\cdot\ems) \\
&=& +0,06\ekg \cdot \ems\\
&=& 0,06\ekg \cdot \ems \mbox{to the right}
\end{eqnarray*}
In the last step the direction was added in words. Since the result
in the second last line is positive, the total momentum of the system
is in the positive direction (i.e. to the right).}
\end{wex}

\item{Two motor cycles are involved in a head on collision. Motorcycle A has a mass of 200 kg and was travelling at 120 \kph south. Motor cycle B has a mass of 250 kg and was travelling north at 100 \kph. A and B are about to collide. Calculate the momentum of the system before the collision takes place.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Change in Momentum}

Let us consider a tennis ball (mass = 0,1 kg) that is dropped at an initial velocity of 5 \ms and bounces back at a final velocity of 3 \ms. As the ball approaches the floor it has a momentum that we call the momentum before the collision. When it moves away from the floor it has a different momentum called the momentum after the collision. The bounce on the floor can be thought of as a collision taking place where the floor exerts a force on the tennis ball to change its momentum.\\



The momentum before the bounce can be calculated as follows:\\
Because momentum and velocity are vectors, we have to choose a direction as positive. For this example we choose the initial direction of motion as positive, in other words, downwards is positive.
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{i} &=& m \cdot v_{i}\\
&=& (0,1 \ekg)(+5 \ems)\\
&=& 0,5\ \ekg\cdot\ems \mbox{downwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

When the tennis ball bounces back it changes direction. The final velocity will thus have a negative value. 
The momentum after the bounce can be calculated as follows:\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{f} &=& m \cdot v_{f}\\
&=& (0,1 \ekg)(-3 \ems)\\
&=& -0,3 \ekg\cdot\ems\\
&=& 0,3\ \ekg\cdot\ems \mbox{upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

Now let us look at what happens to the momentum of the tennis ball. The momentum changes during this bounce. We can calculate the change in momentum as follows:\\
Again we have to choose a direction as positive and we will stick to our initial choice as downwards is positive. This means that the final momentum will have a negative number. \\
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta p &=& p_{f} - p_{i}\\
&=& m \cdot v_{f} - m \cdot v_{i}\\
&=& (-0,3 \ekg) - (0,5 \ems)\\
&=& -0,8 \ekg\cdot\ems\\
&=& 0,8\ \ekg\cdot\ems \mbox{upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

You will notice that this number is bigger than the previous momenta calculated. This is should be the case as the ball needed to be stopped and then given momentum to bounce back. \\

\begin{wex}{Change in Momentum}{A rubber ball of mass 0,8~kg is dropped and strikes the floor with an initial velocity of 6 \ms. It bounces back with a final velocity of 4 \ms. Calculate the change in the momentum of the rubber ball caused by the floor.

We are asked to calculate the change in momentum of the ball,

\subsection{Newton's Second Law revisited}
You have learned about Newton's Second Law of motion earlier in this chapter. 
Newton's Second Law describes the relationship between the motion of an object and the net force on the object. We said that the motion of an object, and therefore its momentum, can only change when a resultant force is acting on it. We can therefore say that because a net force causes an object to move, it also causes its momentum to change. We can now define Newton's Second Law of motion in terms of momentum.\\

\Definition{Newton's Second Law of Motion (N2)}{The net or resultant force acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of momentum.}

Mathematically, Newton's Second Law can be stated as:
\nequ{F_{net}=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}}

\subsection{Impulse}
Impulse is the product of the net force and the time interval for which the force acts. Impulse is defined as:
\equ{\mathrm{Impulse}=F\cdot \Delta t}{eq:impulse}
However, from Newton's Second Law, we know that
\begin{eqnarray*}
F&=&\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}\\
\therefore\quad F \cdot \Delta t\ &=& \Delta p\\
&=&\mathrm{Impulse}
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore,
\nequ{\mathrm{Impulse}=\Delta p}

Impulse is equal to the change in momentum of an object. From this equation we see, that for a given change in momentum, $F_{net}\Delta t$ is fixed. Thus, if $F_{net}$ is reduced, $\Delta t$ must be increased (i.e. a smaller resultant force must be applied for longer to bring about the same change in momentum). Alternatively if $\Delta t$ is reduced (i.e. the resultant force is applied for a shorter period) then the resultant force must be increased to bring about the same change in momentum.\\

\begin{wex}{Impulse and Change in momentum}{A 150 N resultant force acts on a 300 kg trailer. Calculate how long it takes this force to change the trailer's velocity from 2 \ms to 6 \ms in the same direction. Assume that the forces acts to the right.}
{\westep{Identify what information is given and what is asked for}
The question explicitly gives
\begin{itemize}
\item{the trailer's mass as 300 kg,}
\item{the trailer's initial velocity as 2 \ms to the right,}
\item{the trailer's final velocity as 6 \ms to the right, and}
\item{the resultant force acting on the object}
\end{itemize}
all in the correct units!

We are asked to calculate the time taken $\Delta t$ to accelerate the trailer from the 2 to 6 \ms. From the Law of Momentum,
\begin{eqnarray*}
{F}_{net}\Delta t &=& \Delta p \\
&=& mv_f-mv_i\\
&=& m(v_f - v_i).
\end{eqnarray*}

Thus we have everything we need to find $\Delta t$!\\

\westep{Choose a frame of reference}
Choose right as the positive direction.\\

\westep{Do the calculation and quote the final answer}
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{net}\Delta t &=& m(v_f - v_i)\\
(+150 \eN)\Delta t &=& (300 \ekg)((+6 \ems)-(+2 \ems))\\
(+150 \eN)\Delta t &=& (300 \ekg)(+4 \ems)\\
\Delta t &=& \frac{(300 \ekg)(+4 \ems)}{+150 \eN}\\
\Delta t &=& 8\es
\end{eqnarray*}
It takes 8~s for the force to change the object's velocity from 2 \ms to the right to 6 \ms to the right.}

\begin{wex}{Impulsive cricketers!}{A cricket ball weighing 156~g is moving at 54~\kph towards a batsman. It is hit by the batsman back towards the bowler at 36~\kph. Calculate
\begin{enumerate}
\item the ball's impulse, and
\item the average force exerted by the bat if the ball is in contact with the bat for 0,13~s.
\end{enumerate}}{\westep{Identify what information is given and what is asked for}
The question explicitly gives
\begin{itemize}
\item the ball's mass,
\item the ball's initial velocity,
\item the ball's final velocity, and
\item the time of contact between bat and ball
\end{itemize}

We are asked to calculate the impulse
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Impulse} = \Delta p = F_{net}\Delta t
\end{equation*}
Since we do not have the force exerted by the bat on the ball (F$_{net}$), we have to calculate the impulse from the change in momentum of the ball. Now, since 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta p &=& p_{f}-p_{i}\\
&=& mv_f - mv_i,
\end{eqnarray*}
we need the ball's mass, initial velocity and final velocity, which we are given.\\
\westep{Convert to S.I. units}
Firstly let us change units for the mass
\begin{eqnarray*}
1000\ \mathrm{g} &=& 1\ekg\\
\mbox{So, }1\ \mathrm{g} &=& \frac{1}{1000}\ \mathrm{kg}\\
\therefore 156 \times 1\ \mathrm{g} &=& 156 \times \frac{1}{1000}\ \mathrm{kg}\\
&=& 0,156~\ekg
\end{eqnarray*}
Next we change units for the velocity
\begin{eqnarray*}
1\ \mathrm{km\cdot h^{-1}} &=& \frac{1000 \emm}{3\ 600\es}\\
\therefore 54 \times 1\ \mathrm{km\cdot h^{-1}} &=& 54 \times \frac{1\,000 \emm}{3\,600\es}\\
&=&15\ems
\end{eqnarray*}

Similarly, 36 \kph = 10 \ms.\\

\westep{Choose a frame of reference}
Let us choose the direction from the batsman to the bowler as the positive direction. Then the initial velocity of the ball is $v_i$ = -15 \ms, while the final velocity of the ball is $v_f$ = 10 \ms.

\westep{Calculate the momentum}
Now we calculate the change in momentum,
\begin{eqnarray*}
p &=& p_{f} - p_{i}\\
&=& mv_f - mv_i\\
&=& m(v_f - v_i)\\
&=&(0,156 \ekg)((+10 \ems)-(-15 \ems))\\
&=& +3,9 \ekg\cdot\ems\\
&=& 3,9 \ekg\cdot\ems \mbox{in the direction from batsman to bowler}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Determine the impulse}
Finally since impulse is just the change in momentum of the ball,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{Impulse} &=& \Delta p\\
&=& 3,9 \ekg\cdot\ems \mbox{in the direction from batsman to bowler}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Determine the average force exerted by the bat}
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Impulse} = F_{net}\Delta t = \Delta p
\end{equation*}
We are given $\Delta t$ and we have calculated the impulse of the ball.
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{net}\Delta t &=& \mathrm{Impulse}\\
F_{net}(0,13 \es) &=& +3,9 \eN\cdot\es\\
F_{net} &=& \frac{+3,9\eN\cdot\es}{0,13\es}\\
&=& +30 \eN\\
&=& 30\eN\quad \mbox{in the direction from batsman to bowler}
\end{eqnarray*}}

\subsection{Conservation of Momentum}
In the absence of an external force acting on a system, momentum is conserved.

\Definition{Conservation of Linear Momentum}{The total linear momentum of an isolated system is constant. An isolated system has no forces acting on it from the outside.}

This means that in an isolated system the total momentum before a collision or explosion is equal to the total momentum after the collision or explosion.

Consider a simple collision of two billiard balls. The balls are rolling on a frictionless surface and the system is isolated. So, we can apply conservation of momentum. The first ball has a mass $m_1$ and an initial velocity $v_{i1}$. The second ball has a mass $m_2$ and moves towards the first ball with an initial velocity $v_{i2}$. This
situation is shown in Figure~\ref{fig_mom1}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-3,0)(3,1)
%\psgrid[gridcolor=lightgray]
\psline[linewidth=2pt](-3,0)(3,0)
\pscircle(-2,0.5){0.5}
\pscircle(2,0.5){0.5}

\rput(2,0.5){$m_2$}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}
\caption{Before the collision.}
\label{fig_mom1}
\end{figure}

The total momentum of the system before the collision, $p_i$ is:
\nequ{p_{i}=m_1v_{i1} + m_2v_{i2}}

After the two balls collide and move away they each have a different momentum. If the first ball has a final velocity of $v_{f1}$ and the second ball has a final velocity of $v_{f2}$ then we have the situation shown in Figure~\ref{fig_mom2}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-3,0)(3,1)
%\psgrid[gridcolor=lightgray]
\psline[linewidth=2pt](-3,0)(3,0)

\uput[u](2.5,0.5){$v_{f2}$}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}
\caption{After the collision.}
\label{fig_mom2}
\end{figure}

The total momentum of the system after the collision, $p_f$ is:
\nequ{p_{f}=m_1v_{f1} + m_2v_{f2}}

This system of two balls is isolated since there are no external forces acting on the balls. Therefore, by the principle of conservation of linear momentum, the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. This gives the equation for the conservation of momentum in a collision of two objects,

\begin{center}
\psshadowbox{
\begin{tabular}{rl}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{$p_{i}=p_{f}$}\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{$m_1v_{i1} + m_2v_{i2} = m_1v_{f1} + m_2v_{f2}$}\\
\\
$m_1$&: mass of object 1 (kg)\\
$m_2$&: mass of object 2 (kg)\\
$v_{i1}$&: initial velocity of object 1 (\ms + direction)\\
$v_{i2}$&: initial velocity of object 2 (\ms - direction)\\
$v_{f1}$&: final velocity of object 1 (\ms - direction)\\
$v_{f2}$&: final velocity of object 2 (\ms + direction)\\
\end{tabular}}
\end{center}

This equation is always true - momentum is always conserved in collisions.

The helicopter and missile are connected initially and move at the same velocity. We will therefore combine their masses and change the momentum equation as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{i}&=& p_{f}\\
(m_1 + m_2)v_{i} &=& m_1v_{f1} + m_2v_{f2}\\
(5000\ekg + 50\ekg)(275 \ems) &=& (5000 \ekg)(v_{f1}) + (50 \ekg)(700 \ems)\\
1388750\ekg\cdot\ems -35000\ekg\cdot\ems &=& (5000 \ekg)(v_{f1})\\
v_{f1} &=& 270,75 \ems
\end{eqnarray*}
Note that speed is asked and not velocity, therefore no direction is included in the answer.

\subsection{Physics in Action: Impulse}
A very important application of impulse is improving safety and reducing injuries. In many cases, an object needs to be brought to rest from a certain initial velocity. This means there is a certain specified change in momentum. If the time during which the momentum changes can be increased then the force that must be applied will be less and so it will cause less damage. This is the principle behind arrestor beds for trucks, airbags, and bending your knees when you jump off a chair and land on the ground.

\subsubsection{Air-Bags in Motor Vehicles}
Air bags are used in motor vehicles because they are able to reduce the effect of the force experienced by a person during an accident. Air bags extend the time required to stop the momentum of the driver and passenger. During a collision, the motion of the driver and passenger carries them towards the windshield. If they are stopped by a collision with the windshield, it would result in a large force exerted over a short time in order to bring them to a stop. If instead of hitting the windshield, the driver and passenger hit an air bag, then the time of the impact is increased. Increasing the time of the impact results in a decrease in the force.

\subsubsection{Padding as Protection During Sports}
The same principle explains why wicket keepers in cricket use padded gloves or why there are padded mats in gymnastics. In cricket, when the wicket keeper catches the ball, the padding is slightly compressible, thus reducing the effect of the force on the wicket keepers hands. Similarly, if a gymnast falls, the padding compresses and reduces the effect of the force on the gymnast's body.

\subsubsection{Arrestor Beds for Trucks}
An arrestor bed is a patch of ground that is softer than the road. Trucks use these when they have to make an emergency stop. When a trucks reaches an arrestor bed the time interval over which the momentum is changed is increased. This decreases the force and causes the truck to slow down.

\subsubsection{Follow-Through in Sports}
In sports where rackets and bats are used, like tennis, cricket, squash, badminton and baseball, the hitter is often encouraged to follow-through when striking the ball. High speed films of the collisions between bats/rackets and balls have shown that following through increases the time over which the collision between the racket/bat and ball occurs. This increase in the time of the collision causes an increase in the velocity change of the ball. This means that a hitter can cause the ball to leave the racket/bat faster by following through. In these sports, returning the ball with a higher velocity often increases the chances of success.

\subsubsection{Crumple Zones in Cars}
Another safety application of trying to reduce the force experienced is in crumple zones in cars. When two cars have a collision, two things can happen:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the cars bounce off each other, or
\item the cars crumple together.
\end{enumerate}

Which situation is more dangerous for the occupants of the cars? When cars bounce off each other, or rebound, there is a larger change in momentum and therefore a larger impulse. A larger impulse means that a greater force is experienced by the occupants of the cars. When cars crumple together, there is a smaller change in momentum and therefore a smaller impulse. The smaller impulse means that the occupants of the cars experience a smaller force. Car manufacturers use this idea and design crumple zones into cars, such that the car has a greater chance of crumpling than rebounding in a collision. Also, when the car crumples, the change in the car's momentum happens over a longer time. Both these effects result in a smaller force on the occupants of the car, thereby increasing their chances of survival.

\Activity{Egg Throw}{This activity demonstrates the effect of impulse and how it is used to improve safety. Have two learners hold up a bed sheet or large piece of fabric. Then toss an egg at the sheet. The egg should not break, because the collision between the egg and the bed sheet lasts over an extended period of time since the bed sheet has some give in it. By increasing the time of the collision, the force of the impact is minimized. Take care to aim at the sheet, because if you miss the sheet, you will definitely break the egg and have to clean up the mess!}

\section{Torque and Levers}
\subsection{Torque}

This chapter has dealt with forces and how they lead to motion in a straight line. In this section, we examine how forces lead to rotational motion.

When an object is fixed or supported at one point and a force acts on it a distance away from the support, it tends to make the object turn. The moment of force or \textit{torque} (symbol, $\tau$ read \textit{tau}) is defined as the product of the distance from the support or pivot ($r$) and the component of force perpendicular to the object, $F_{\perp}$.

\equ{\tau=F_{\perp} \cdot r}{eq:fmig11:torque}

Torque can be seen as a rotational force. The unit of torque is N$\cdot$m and torque is a vector quantity. Some examples of where torque arises are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:fmig11:torque:seesaw}, \ref{fig:fmig11:torque:propellor} and \ref{fig:fmig11:torque:spanner}.

\caption{The force exerted on a spanner helps to loosen the bolt.}
\label{fig:fmig11:torque:spanner}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

For example in Figure~\ref{fig:fmig11:torque:spanner}, if a force $F$ of 10~N is applied perpendicularly to the spanner at a distance $r$ of 0,3~m from the center of the bolt, then the torque applied to the bolt is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tau&=&F_{\perp} \cdot r\\
&=&(10\,\eN)(0,3\emm)\\
&=&3\,\mathrm{N\cdot m}
\end{eqnarray*}
If the force of 10~N is now applied at a distance of 0,15~m from the centre of the bolt, then the torque is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tau&=&F_{\perp} \cdot r\\
&=&(10\,\eN)(0,15\emm)\\
&=&1,5\,\mathrm{N\cdot m}
\end{eqnarray*}
This shows that there is less torque when the force is applied closer to the bolt than further away.

\Tip{Loosening a bolt}{If you are trying to loosen (or tighten) a bolt, apply the force on the spanner further away from the bolt, as this results in a greater torque to the bolt making it easier to loosen.}

\Tip{Any component of a force exerted parallel to an object will not cause the object to turn. Only perpendicular components cause turning.}

\Tip{Torques}{The direction of a torque is either clockwise or anticlockwise. When torques are added, choose one direction as positive and the opposite direction as negative. If equal clockwise and anticlockwise torques are applied to an object, they will cancel out and there will be no net turning effect.}

\subsection{Mechanical Advantage and Levers}
We can use our knowlegde about the moments of forces (torque) to determine whether situations are balanced. For example two mass pieces are placed on a seesaw as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fmig11:torque:balance}. The one mass is 3 kg and the other is 6 kg. The masses are placed at distances of 2 m and 1 m (respectively) from the pivot. By looking at the clockwise and anti-clockwise moments, we can determine whether the seesaw will pivot (move) or not. If the sum of the clockwise and anti-clockwise moments is zero, the seesaw is in equilibrium (i.e. balanced).

The clockwise moment can be calculated as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tau_1 &=& F_{\perp}\cdot r\\
\tau_1 &=& (6 \ekg)(9,8 \emss)(1 m)\\
\tau_1 &=& 58,8 N \cdot m~\mbox{clockwise}
\end{eqnarray*}


The anti-clockwise moment can be calculated as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tau_2 &=& F_{\perp}\cdot r\\
\tau_2 &=& (3 \ekg)(9,8 \emss)(2 m)\\
\tau_2 &=& 58,8 N \cdot m~ \mbox{anti-clockwise}
\end{eqnarray*}

The sum of the moments of force will be zero:

The resultant moment is zero as the clockwise and anti-clockwise moments of force are in opposite directions and therefore cancel each other. \\

As we see in Figure~\ref{fig:fmig11:torque:balance}, we can use different distances away from a pivot to balance two different forces. This principle is applied to a lever to make lifting a heavy object much easier.

\Definition{Lever}{A lever is a rigid object that is used with an appropriate fulcrum or pivot point to multiply the mechanical force that can be applied to another object.}

\end{figure}

\begin{IFact}{Archimedes reputedly said: \textit{Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.}}\end{IFact}

The concept of getting out more than the effort is termed mechanical advantage, and is one example of the principle of moments. The lever allows one to apply a smaller force over a greater distance. For instance to lift a certain unit of weight with a lever with an effort of half a unit we need a distance from the fulcrum in the effort's side to be twice the distance of the weight's side. It also means that to lift the weight 1 meter we need to push the lever for 2 meters. The amount of work done is always the same and independent of the dimensions of the lever (in an ideal lever). The lever only allows to trade force for distance.

Ideally, this means that the mechanical advantage of a system is the ratio of the force that performs the work (output or load) to the applied force (input or effort), assuming there is no friction in the system. In reality, the mechanical advantage will be less than the ideal value by an amount determined by the amount of friction.

\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{mechanical~advantage}=\frac{\mathrm{load}}{\mathrm{effort}}
\end{equation*}

For example, you want to raise an object of mass 100~kg. If the pivot is placed as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fmig11:torque:mechanicaladvantage:example}, what is the mechanical advantage of the lever?

\end{pspicture}
\caption{A lever is used to put in a small effort to get out a large load.}
\label{fig:fmig11:torque:mechanicaladvantage:example}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In order to calculate mechanical advantage, we need to determine the load and effort.

\Tip{Effort is the input force and load is the output force.}

The load is easy to calculate, it is simply the weight of the 100~kg object.
\nequ{F_{load}=m \cdot g = 100\ekg \cdot 9,8\emss = 980\eN}

The effort is found by balancing torques.
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{load}\cdot r_{load} &=& F_{effort}\cdot r_{effort} \\
980\eN \cdot 0.5\emm &=&F_{effort} \cdot 1\emm\\
F_{effort}&=&\frac{980\eN \cdot 0.5\emm}{1\emm}\\
&=&490\eN
\end{eqnarray*}

The mechanical advantage is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{mechanical~advantage}&=&\frac{\mathrm{load}}{\mathrm{effort}}\\
&=&\frac{980\eN}{490\eN}\\
&=&2
\end{eqnarray*}

Since mechanical advantage is a ratio, it does not have any units.

\Extension{Pulleys}{Pulleys change the direction of a tension force on a flexible material, e.g. a rope or cable. In addition, pulleys can be ``added together'' to create mechanical advantage, by having the flexible material looped over several pulleys in turn. More loops and pulleys increases the mechanical advantage.}

\subsection{Classes of levers}

{\bf{Class 1 levers}}\\
In a class 1 lever the fulcrum is between the effort and the load. Examples of class 1 levers are the seesaw, crowbar and equal-arm balance. The mechanical advantage of a class 1 lever can be increased by moving the fulcrum closer to the load.

{\bf{Class 2 levers}}\\
In class 2 levers the fulcrum is at the one end of the bar, with the load closer to the fulcrum and the effort on the other end of bar. The mechanical advantage of this type of lever can be increased by increasing the length of the bar. A bottle opener or wheel barrow are examples of class 2 levers.

\section{Summary}
\begin{description}
\item[Newton's First Law] Every object will remain at rest or in
uniform motion in a straight line unless it is made to change its
state by the action of an \emph{unbalanced force}.
\item[Newton's Second Law] The resultant force acting on a body
will cause the body to accelerate in the direction of the 
resultant force The acceleration of the body is directly proportional to the magnitude of
the resultant force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
\item[Newton's Third Law] If body A exerts a force on body B then body B 
will exert an equal but opposite force on body A.
\item[Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation] Every body in the universe exerts a force on every other body. The force is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the bodies and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
\item[Equilibrium] Objects at rest or moving with constant velocity
are in {\em equilibrium} and have a {\em zero} {\em resultant force}.
\item[Equilibrant] The {\em equilibrant} of any number of forces is
the single force required to produce equilibrium.
\item[Triangle Law for Forces in Equilibrium] Three forces in
equilibrium can be represented in magnitude and direction by the
three sides of a triangle taken in order.
\item[Momentum] The {\em momentum} of an object is defined as its
mass multiplied by its velocity.
\item[Momentum of a System] The {\em total momentum of a system}
is the sum of the momenta of each of the objects in the system.
\item[Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum:] `The total linear
momentum of an isolated system is constant' or `In an isolated
system the total momentum before a collision (or explosion) is equal
to the total momentum after the collision (or explosion)'.
\item[Law of Momentum:] The applied resultant force acting on an
object is equal to the rate of change of the object's momentum and
this force is in the direction of the change in momentum.

\chapter{Geometrical Optics - Grade 11}
\label{p:wsl:go11}

\section{Introduction}
In Grade 10, we studied how light is reflected and refracted. This chapter builds on what you have learnt in Grade 10. You will learn about lenses, how the human eye works as well as how telescopes and microscopes work.

\section{Lenses}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to describe the two general types of lenses, those that converge parallel beams of light (converging lenses), and those that diverge parallel beams of light (diverging lenses).
%\item The learner must be able to describe all converging lenses as thicker in the middle than at the edge (convex), and all diverging lenses as thicker at the edge than in the middle (concave).
%\item The learner must be able to define optic axis, focal point and focal length (f).
%\item The learner must be able to draw ray diagrams for converging and diverging lenses to locate the position of the image when the object is placed at distances from the lens greater than 2f, equal to 2f, between 2f and f, and less than f.
%\item The learner must be able to describe the image in each of the cases mentioned above.
%\item Notes: Learners should not try to memorise the ray diagrams for different lenses and object positions. The image of a point on an object can be located as follows:1. For a converging lens, draw one ray from the point on the object straight through the centre of the lens. Draw a second ray from the object, parallel to the optic axis, and passing through the focal point on the other side of the lens. The image position is where these two lines cross.2. For a diverging lens, draw one ray from the point on the object straight through the centre of the lens. Draw a second ray from the object, parallel to the optic axis that emerges on the other side of the lens at an angle that makes it look as if it came from the focal point on the same side of the lens as the object. Extend this ray back to this focal point using a dotted line. The image position is where the two lines cross.
%\end{syllabus}

In this section we will discuss properties of \textbf{thin lenses}. In Grade 10, you learnt about two kinds of mirrors: concave mirrors which were also known as converging mirrors and convex mirrors which were also known as diverging mirrors. Similarly, there are two types of lenses: converging and diverging lenses. 

We have learnt how light travels in different materials, and we are now ready to learn how we can control the direction of light rays. We use \textit{lenses} to control the direction of light. When light enters a lens, the light rays bend or change direction as shown in Figure~\ref{p:wsl:go11:l:rays}.

\Definition{Lens}{A lens is any transparent material (e.g. glass) of an appropriate shape that can take parallel rays of incident light and either converge the rays to a point or diverge the rays from a point.}

Some lenses will focus light rays to a single point. These lenses are called converging or convex lenses. Other lenses spread out the light rays so that it looks like they all come from the same point. These lenses are called diverging or concave lenses. Lenses change the direction of light rays by \textit{refraction}. They are designed so that the image appears in a certain place or as a certain size. Lenses are used in eyeglasses, cameras, microscopes, and telescopes. You also have lenses in your eyes!

\Definition{Converging Lenses}{Converging lenses converge parallel rays of light and are thicker in the middle than at the edges.}
\Definition{Diverging Lenses}{Diverging lenses diverge parallel rays of light and are thicker at the edges than in the middle.}

Examples of converging and diverging lenses are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lenses}.

\caption{Types of lenses}
\label{fig:lenses}
\end{figure}

Before we study lenses in detail, there are a few important terms that must be defined. Figure~\ref{p:wsl:go11:l:properties} shows important lens properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item{The \textbf{principal axis} is the line which runs horizontally straight through the \textit{optical centre} of the lens. It is also sometimes called the \textit{optic axis}.}
\item{The \textbf{optical centre} (O) of a convex lens is usually the centre point of the lens. The direction of all light rays which pass through the optical centre, remains unchanged.}
\item{The \textbf{focus} or \textbf{focal point} of the lens is
the position on the \textit{principal axis}
where all light rays which run \textit{parallel} to the principal axis through the lens converge (come together) at a point. Since light can pass through the lens either from right to left or left to right, there is a focal point on each side of the lens ($F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$), at the same distance from the optical centre in each direction. (\textbf{Note:} the plural form of the word focus is \textit{foci}.)}
\item{The \textbf{focal length} ($f$) is the distance between the \textit{optical centre} and the \textit{focal point}.}
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{p:wsl:go11:cl:cl} shows a convex lens. Light rays traveling through a \textbf{convex} lens are bent \textbf{towards} the principal axis. For this reason, convex lenses are called \textbf{converging} lenses.

When an object is placed in front of a lens, the light rays coming from the object are refracted by the lens. An image of the object is produced at the point where the light rays intersect.
The type of images created by a convex lens is dependent on the position of the object. We will examine the following cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the object is placed at a distance greater than $2f$ from the lens
\item the object is placed at a distance equal to $2f$ from the lens
\item the object is placed at a distance between $2f$ and $f$ from the lens
\item the object is placed at a distance less than $f$ from the lens
\end{enumerate}

We examine the properties of the image in each of these cases by drawing ray diagrams. We can find the image by tracing the path of three light rays through the lens. Any two of these rays will show us the location of the image. The third ray is used to check that the location is correct.


\Activity{Experiment}{Lenses A}
{
\Aim{To determine the focal length of a convex lens.}

\Method{
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using a distant object from outside, adjust the position of the convex lens so that it gives the smallest possible focus on a sheet of paper that is held parallel to the lens.
\item Measure the distance between the lens and the sheet of paper as accurately as possible.
\end{enumerate}
}

\Results{
The focal length of the lens is \underline{\hspace{3cm}} cm
}
}

\Activity{Experiment}{Lenses B}{
\Aim{To investigate the position, size and nature of the image formed by a convex lens.}

\Method{
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set up a candle, and the lens from Experiment Lenses A in its holder and the screen in a straight line on the metre rule. Make sure the lens holder is on the 50 cm mark.

From your knowledge of the focal length of your lens, note where $f$ and $2f$ are on both sides of the lens.

\item Using the position indicated on the table below, start with the candle at a position that is greater than $2f$ and adjust the position of the screen until a sharp focused image is obtained. Note that there are two positions for which a sharp focused image will not be obtained on the screen. When this is so, remove the screen and look at the candle through the lens.

\item Fill in the relevant information on the table below

\textbf{Drawing Ray Diagrams for Converging Lenses}

Ray diagrams are normally drawn using three rays. The three rays are labelled $R_{1}$, $R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$. The ray diagrams that follow will use this naming convention.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{The first ray ($R_{1}$) travels from the object to the lens \textit{parallel} to the principal axis. This ray is bent by the lens and travels through the \textbf{focal point}.}
\item{\textit{Any} ray travelling parallel to the principal axis is bent through the focal point.}
\item{If a light ray passes through a focal point \textit{before} it enters the lens, then it will leave the lens \textit{parallel} to the principal axis. The second ray ($R_2$) is therefore drawn to pass through the focal point before it enters the lens.}
\item{A ray that travels through the centre of the lens does not change direction. The third ray ($R_3$) is drawn through the centre of the lens.}
\item{The point where all three of the rays ($R_{1}$, $R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$) intersect is the \textbf{image} of the point where they all started. The image will form at this point.}
\end{enumerate}

\Tip{In ray diagrams, lenses are drawn like this:\\

\label{p:wsl:go11:cl:f1}

\end{figure}

We can locate the position of the image by drawing our three rays. $R_{1}$ travels from the object to the lens parallel to the principal axis, is bent by the lens and then travels through the focal point. $R_{2}$ passes through the focal point before it enters the lens and therefore must leave the lens parallel to the principal axis. $R_{3}$ travels through the center of the lens and does not change direction. The point where $R_{1}$, $R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ intersect is the image of the point where they all started. 

The image of an object placed at a distance greater than $2f$ from the lens is upside down or \textit{inverted}. This is because the rays which began at the top of the object, \textit{above} the principal axis, after passing through the lens end up \textit{below} the principal axis. The image is called a \textbf{real image} because it is on the opposite side of the lens to the object and you can trace all the light rays directly from the image back to the object.

The image is also smaller than the object and is located closer to the lens than the object.

\Tip{In reality, light rays come from \textit{all} points along the length of the object. In ray diagrams we only draw three rays (all starting at the top of the object) to keep the diagram clear and simple.}

We can locate the position of the image by drawing our three rays. $R_{1}$ travels from the object to the lens parallel to the principal axis and is bent by the lens and then travels through the focal point. $R_{2}$ passes through the focal point before it enters the lens and therefore must leave the lens parallel to the principal axis. $R_{3}$ travels through the center of the lens and does not change direction. The point where $R_{1}$, $R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ intersect is the image of the point where they all started. 

The image of an object placed at a distance equal to $2f$ from the lens is upside down or \textit{inverted}. This is because the rays which began at the top of the object, \textit{above} the principal axis, after passing through the lens end up \textit{below} the principal axis. The image is called a \textbf{real image} because it is on the opposite side of the lens to the object and you can trace all the light rays directly from the image back to the object.

The image is the same size as the object and is located at a distance $2f$ away from the lens.

The image of an object placed at a distance less than $f$ from the lens is upright. The image is called a \textbf{virtual image} because it is on the same side of the lens as the object and you \textit{cannot} trace all the light rays directly from the image back to the object.

The image is larger than the object and is located further away from the lens than the object.

\Extension{The thin lens equation and magnification}{

\textbf{The Thin Lens Equation}

We can find the position of the image of a lens mathematically as there is a mathematical relation between the object distance, image distance, and focal length. The equation is:
\nequ{\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}}
where $f$ is the focal length, $d_o$ is the object distance and $d_i$ is the image distance.

The object distance $d_o$ is the distance from the object to the lens. $d_o$ is positive if the object is on the same side of the lens as the light rays enter the lens. This should make sense: we expect the light rays to travel from the object to the lens. The image distance $d_i$ is the distance from the lens to the image. Unlike mirrors, which reflect light back, lenses refract light through them. We expect to find the image on the same side of the lens as the light leaves the lens. If this is the case, then $d_i$ is \textit{positive} and the image is \textbf{real} (see Figure~\ref{p:wsl:go11:cl:f3}). Sometimes the image will be on the same side of the lens as the light rays enter the lens. Then $d_i$ is \textit{negative} and the image is \textbf{virtual} (Figure~\ref{p:wsl:go11:cl:f4}). If we know any two of the three quantities above, then we can use the Thin Lens Equation to solve for the third quantity.\\

\textbf{Magnification}

It is possible to calculate the magnification of an image. The magnification is how much \textit{bigger} or \textit{smaller}
the image is than the object.
\nequ{m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}}
where $m$ is the magnification, $d_o$ is the object distance and $d_i$ is the image distance. 

If $d_i$ and $d_o$ are both positive, the magnification is negative. This means the image is inverted, or upside down. If $d_i$ is negative and $d_o$ is positive, then the image is not inverted, or right side up. If the absolute value of the magnification is \textit{greater than one}, the image is \textit{larger} than the object. For example, a magnification of -2 means the image is \textit{inverted} and \textit{twice as big} as the object.}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{p:wsl:go11:dl:dl} shows a concave lens with light rays travelling through it. You can see that concave lenses have the opposite curvature to convex lenses. This causes light rays passing through a concave lens to \textbf{diverge} or be spread out \textit{away} from the principal axis. For this reason, concave lenses are called \textbf{diverging lenses.} Images formed by concave lenses are \textit{always} virtual.\\

Unlike converging lenses, the type of images created by a concave lens is not dependent on the position of the object. The image is \textit{always} upright, smaller than the object, and located closer to the lens than the object.\\

We examine the properties of the image by drawing ray diagrams. We can find the image by tracing the path of three light rays through the lens. Any two of these rays will show us the location of the image. You can use the third ray to check the location, but it is not necessary to show it on your diagram.\\

\newpage
\textbf{Drawing Ray Diagrams for Diverging Lenses}\\
Draw the three rays starting at the top of the object.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ray $R_{1}$ travels parallel to the principal axis. The ray bends and lines up with a focal point. However, the concave lens is a \textit{diverging} lens, so the ray must line up with the focal point on the same side of the lens where light rays enter it. This means that we must project an imaginary line backwards through that focal point ($F_{1}$) (shown by the dashed line extending from $R_{1}$).
\item Ray $R_{2}$ points towards the focal point $F_{2}$ on the opposite side of the lens. When it hits the lens, it is bent parallel to the principal axis.
\item Ray $R_{3}$ passes through the optical center of the lens. Like for the convex lens, this ray passes through with its direction unchanged.
\item We find the image by locating the point where the rays meet. Since the rays diverge, they will only meet if projected backward to a point on the same side of the lens as the object. This is why concave lenses \textit{always} have virtual images. (Since the light rays do not actually meet at the image, the image cannot be real.)
\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{p:wsl:go11:dl:f1} shows an object placed at an arbitrary distance from the diverging lens.

We can locate the position of the image by drawing our three rays for a diverging lens. 

Figure~\ref{p:wsl:go11:dl:f1} shows that the image of an object is upright. The image is called a \textbf{virtual image} because it is on the same side of the lens as the object.

The image is smaller than the object and is closer to the lens than the object.

point $F_{2}$. After it passes through the lens, it travels parallel to the
principal axis.

with its direction unchanged.

\section{The Human Eye}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to describe how the human eye has a converging lens to create real, inverted, reduced images on the retina at the back of the eye. Focusing is achieved by muscles, which change the focal length of the lens.
%\item The learner must be able to understand the meanings of long-sightedness, short-sightedness and astigmatism what causes these defects of vision.
%\item The learner must be able to use simple diagrams to show how converging lenses can correct long-sightedness and diverging lenses can correct short-sightedness.
%\item The learner must be able to describe how astigmatism is corrected by a special lens, which has different focal lengths in the vertical and horizontal planes.
%\end{syllabus} 

\Activity{Investigation}{Model of the Human Eye}{
This demonstration shows that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The eyeball has a spherical shape.
\item The pupil is a small hole in the front and middle of the eye that lets light into the eye.
\item The retina is at the back of the eyeball.
\item The images that we see are formed on the retina.
\item The images on the retina are upside down. The brain inverts the images so that what we see is the right way up.
\end{enumerate}

You will need:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a round, clear glass bowl
\item water
\item a sheet of cardboard covered with black paper
\item a sheet of cardboard covered with white paper
\item a small desk lamp with an incandescent light-bulb or a candle and a match
\end{enumerate} 

You will have to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fill the glass bowl with water.
\item Make a small hole in the middle of the black cardboard.
\item Place the black cardboard against one side of the bowl and the white cardboard on the other side of the bowl so that it is opposite the black cardboard.
\item Turn on the lamp (or light the candle).
\item Place the lamp so it is shining through the hole in the black cardboard.
\item Make the room as dark as possible.
\item Move the white cardboard until an image of the light bulb or candle appears on it.
\end{enumerate}

You now have a working model of the human eye.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The hole in the black cardboard represents the pupil. The pupil is a small hole in the front of the eyeball that lets light into the eye.
\item The round bowl of water represents the eyeball.
\item The white cardboard represents the retina. Images are projected onto the retina and are then sent to the brain via the optic nerve.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Tasks}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is the image on the retina right-side up or upside down? Explain why.
\item Draw a simple labelled diagram of the model of the eye showing which part of the eye each part of the model represents.
\end{enumerate}}

\subsection{Structure of the Eye}
Eyesight begins with lenses. As light rays enter your eye, they pass first through the \textbf{cornea} and then through the \textbf{crystalline lens}. These form a double lens system and focus light rays onto the back wall of the eye, called the \textbf{retina}. \textbf{Rods} and \textbf{cones} are nerve cells on the retina that transform light into electrical signals. These signals are sent to the brain via the \textbf{optic nerve}. A cross-section of the eye is shown in Figure \ref{fig:p:wsl:go11:eye:eye}.

\end{figure}

For clear vision, the image must be formed right on the retina, not in front of or behind it. To accomplish this, you may need a long or short focal length, depending on the object distance. How do we get the exact right focal length we need? Remember that the lens system has two parts. The cornea is fixed in place but the crystalline lens is flexible -- it can change shape. When the shape of the lens changes, its focal length also changes. You have muscles in your eye called \textbf{ciliary muscles} that control the shape of the crystalline lens. When you focus your gaze on something, you are squeezing (or relaxing) these muscles. This process of \textbf{accommodation} changes the focal length of the lens and allows you to see an image clearly. 

The lens in the eye creates a real image that is smaller than the object and is inverted \\(Figure~\ref{fig:p:wsl:go11:eye:normal}).

If the muscles in the eye are unable to accommodate adequately, the image will not be in focus. This leads to problems with vision. There are three basic conditions that arise:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{short-sightedness}
\item{long-sightedness}
\item{astigmatism}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Short-sightedness}
Short-sightedness or \textbf{myopia} is a defect of vision which means that the image is focused in front of the retina. Close objects are seen clearly but distant objects appear blurry. This condition can be corrected by placing a diverging lens in front of the eye. The diverging lens spreads out light rays before they enter the eye. The situation for short-sightedness and how to correct it is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:p:wsl:go11:eye:dv:s}.

\caption{Short-sightedness}
\label{fig:p:wsl:go11:eye:dv:s}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Long-sightedness}
Long-sightedness or \textbf{hyperopia} is a defect of vision which means that the image is focused in behind the retina. People with this condition can see distant objects clearly, but not close ones. A converging lens in front of the eye corrects long-sightedness by converging the light rays slightly before they enter the eye. Reading glasses are an example of a converging lens used to correct long-sightedness.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Astigmatism}
Astigmatism is characterised by a cornea or lens that is not spherical, but is more curved in one plane compared to another. This means that horizontal lines may be focused at a different point to vertical lines. Astigmatism causes blurred vision and is corrected by a special lens, which has different focal lengths in the vertical and horizontal planes.

%\section{Gravitational Lenses}
%%\begin{syllabus}
%%\item The learner must be able to state that the gravitational field of massive objects like galaxies, black holes and massive stars bend rays of light that pass close-by in accordance with predictions made by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, and therefore act as a kind of gravitational lens, distorting, and altering the apparent position of, the image of a star.

%Einstein's Theory of General Relativity predicts that light which passes close to very heavy objects like galaxies, black holes and massive stars will be bent. These massive objects therefore act as a kind of lens that is known as a \textit{gravitational lens}. Gravitational lenses distort and change the apparent position of the image of stars.

%If a massive object, such as a galaxy, is acting as a gravitational lens, then an observer from Earth will see multiple images of a star which is located behind the object (Figure~\ref{fig:p:wsl:go11:gl}).

\section{Telescopes}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to draw ray-diagrams illustrating image formation by the refracting astronomical telescope and the reflecting telescope.
%\item The learner must be able to know about the kinds of telescopes used at the Sutherland Observatory in the Western Cape and about the new SALT (South African Large Telescope).
%\item Notes: Here is an excellent opportunity to contextualise the curriculum for South Africa. With the building of SALT, South Africa has become a world leader in optical telescopes.
%\end{syllabus}

We have seen how a simple lens can be used to correct eyesight. Lenses and mirrors are also combined to magnify (or make bigger) objects that are far away.

Telescopes use combinations of lenses to gather and focus light. Telescopes collect light from objects that are large but far away, like planets and galaxies. For this reason, telescopes are the tools of astronomers. \textbf{Astronomy} is the study of objects outside the Earth, like stars, planets, galaxies, comets, and asteroids.

Usually the object viewed with a telescope is very far away. Objects closer to Earth, such as the moon, appear larger, and with a powerful enough telescope, we are able to see craters on the Moon's surface. Objects which are much further, such as stars, appear as points of light. Even with the most powerful telescopes currently built, we are unable to see details on the surfaces of stars. 

There are many kinds of telescopes, but we will look at two basic types: reflecting and refracting. 

\subsection{Refracting Telescopes}
A \textbf{refracting telescope} like the one pictured in Figure \ref{fig:p:wsl:go11:t:refr} uses two convex lenses to enlarge an image. The refracting telescope has a large primary lens with a long focal length to gather a lot of light. The lenses of a refracting telescope share a focal point. This ensures that parallel rays entering the telescope are again parallel when they reach your eye.

\label{fig:p:wsl:go11:t:refr}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Reflecting Telescopes}
Some telescopes use mirrors as well as lenses and are called reflecting telescopes. Specifically, a \textbf{reflecting telescope} uses a convex lens and two mirrors to make an object appear larger. (Figure~\ref{fig:p:wsl:go11:t:refl}.)

Light is collected by the primary mirror, which is large and concave. Parallel rays traveling toward this mirror are reflected and focused to a point. The secondary plane mirror is placed within the focal length of the primary mirror. This changes the direction of the light. A final eyepiece lens diverges the rays so that they are parallel when they reach your eye.

\subsection{Southern African Large Telescope}
\begin{flushleft}The Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) is the largest single optical telescope in the southern hemisphere, with a hexagonal mirror array 11 metres across. SALT is located in Sutherland in the Northern Cape. SALT is able to record images of distant stars, galaxies and quasars a billion times too faint to be seen with the unaided eye. This is equivalent to a person being able to see a candle flame on the moon.\end{flushleft}

SALT was completed in 2005 and is a truly international initiative, because the money to build it came from South Africa, the United States, Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom and New Zealand.

\section{Microscopes}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to draw a ray diagram showing how a compound microscope uses two converging lenses to produce a magnified image of a tiny object.
%\end{syllabus}

We have seen how lenses and mirrors are combined to magnify objects that are far away using a telescope. Lenses can also be used to make very small objects appear bigger. 

Figure~\ref{p:wsl:go11:cl:f4} shows that when an object is placed at a distance less than $f$ from the lens, the image formed is virtual, upright and is larger than the object. This set-up is a simple magnifier.

If you want to look at something very small, two lenses may work better than one. Microscopes and telescopes often use two lenses to make an image large enough to see. 

A \textbf{compound microscope} uses two lenses to achieve high magnification (Figure \ref{fig:micro}). Both lenses are convex, or converging. Light from the object first passes through the \textbf{objective lens}. The lens that you look through is called the \textbf{eyepiece}. The focus of the system can be adjusted by changing the length of the tube between the lenses.

\textbf{Drawing a Ray Diagram for a Two-Lens System}\\
You already have all the tools to analyze a two-lens system. Just consider one lens at a time.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Use ray tracing or the lens equation to find the image for the first lens.}
\item{Use the image of the first lens as the object of the second lens.}
\item{To find the magnification, multiply: $m_{total} = m_1 \times m_2 \times m_3 \times ...$}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{wex}{The Compound Microscope}{A compound microscope consists of two convex lenses. The eyepiece has a focal length of 10 cm. The objective lens has a focal length of 6 cm. The two lenses are 30 cm apart. A 2 cm-tall object is placed 8 cm from the objective lens.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Where is the final image?
\item Is the final image real or virtual?
\end{enumerate}}
{We can use ray tracing to follow light rays through the microscope, one lens at a time.

\westep{Set up the system}
To prepare to trace the light rays, make a diagram. In the diagram here, we place the image on the left side of the microscope. Since the light will pass through the objective lens first, we'll call this Lens 1. The eyepiece will be called Lens 2. Be sure to include the focal points of both lenses in your diagram.

\section{Summary}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item A lens is any transparent material that is shaped in such a way that it will converge parallel incident rays to a point or diverge incident rays from a point. 
\item Converging lenses are thicker in the middle than on the edge and will bend incoming light rays towards the principal axis. 
\item Diverging lenses are thinner in the middle than on the edge and will bend incoming light rays away from the principal axis. 
\item The principal axis of a lens is the horizontal line through the centre of the lens. 
\item The centre of the lens is called the optical centre. 
\item The focus or focal point is a point on the principal axis where parallel rays converge through or diverge from. 
\item The focal length is the distance between the focus and the optical centre. 
\item Ray diagrams are used to determine the position and height of an image formed by a lens. The properties of images formed by converging and diverging lenses are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:p:wsl:go11:l:summary}. 
\item The human eye consists of a lens system that focuses images on the retina where the optic nerve transfers the messages to the brain. 
\item Defects of vision include short-sightedness, long-sightedness and astigmatism. 
\item Massive astronomical bodies, such as galaxies, act as gravitational lenses that can change the apparent positions of the images of stars. 
\item Microscopes and telescopes use systems of lenses to create magnified images of very small or very distant objects.

\chapter{Longitudinal Waves - Grade 11}
\label{p:wsl:lw11}

\section{Introduction}
In Grade 10 we studied pulses and waves. We looked at transverse waves more closely. In this chapter we look at another type of wave called \emph{longitudinal} waves. In transverse waves, the motion of the particles in the medium were perpendicular to the direction of the wave. In longitudinal waves, the particles in the medium move \emph{parallel} (in the \emph{same} direction as) to the motion of the wave. Examples of transverse waves are water waves or light waves. An example of a longitudinal wave is a sound wave.

\section{What is a \emph{longitudinal wave}?}

\Definition{Longitudinal waves}{ A longitudinal wave is a wave where the particles in the medium move parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave.}

When we studied transverse waves we looked at two different motions: the motion of the particles of the medium and the motion of the wave itself. We will do the same for longitudinal waves.

The question is how do we construct such a wave?

To create a transverse wave, we flick the end of for example a rope up and down. The particles move up and down and return to their equilibrium position. The wave moves from left to right and will be displaced.

From the investigation you will have noticed that the disturbance moves parallel to the direction in which the spring was pulled. The spring was pulled down and the wave moved up and down. The ribbon in the investigation represents one particle in the medium. The particles in the medium move in the same direction as the wave. The ribbon moves from rest upwards, then back to its original position, then down and then back to its original position.

\section{Characteristics of Longitudinal Waves}

As in the case of transverse waves the following properties can be defined for longitudinal waves:
wavelength, amplitude, period, frequency and wave speed. However instead of peaks and troughs, longitudinal waves have \textit{compressions} and \textit{rarefactions}.

\Definition{Compression}{ A \textbf{compression} is a region in a longitudinal wave where the particles are closest together.}

\Definition{Rarefaction}{ A \textbf{rarefaction} is a region in a longitudinal wave where the particles are furthest apart.}

\subsection{Compression and Rarefaction}
As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:p:wsl:lw11:cr}, there are regions where the medium is compressed and other regions where the medium is spread out in a longitudinal wave.

The region where the medium is compressed is known as a \textbf{compression} and the region where the medium is spread out is known as a \textbf{rarefaction}.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Wavelength and Amplitude}
\Definition{Wavelength}{ The \textbf{wavelength} in a longitudinal wave is the distance between two consecutive points that are in phase.}

The wavelength in a longitudinal wave refers to the distance between two consecutive compressions or between two consecutive rarefactions.

\Definition{Amplitude}{ The \textbf{amplitude} is the maximum displacement from a position of rest.}

\caption{Wavelength on a longitudinal wave}
\label{fig:p:wsl:lw11:w}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The amplitude is the distance from the equilibrium position of the medium to a compression or a rarefaction.

\subsection{Period and Frequency}

\Definition{Period}{ The \textbf{period} of a wave is the time taken by the wave to move one wavelength.}

\Definition{Frequency}{ The \textbf{frequency} of a wave is the number of wavelengths per second. }

The \emph{period} of a longitudinal wave is the time taken by the wave to move one wavelength. As for transverse waves, the symbol $T$ is used to represent period and period is measured in seconds (s).

The \textit{frequency} $f$ of a wave is the number of wavelengths per second. Using this definition and the fact that the period is the time taken for 1 wavelength, we can define:
\begin{equation*}
f=\frac{1}{T}
\end{equation*}
or alternately,
\begin{equation*}
T=\frac{1}{f}.
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Speed of a Longitudinal Wave}
The speed of a longitudinal wave is defined as:

\nequ{v=f\cdot \lambda}

where \\
$v$ = speed in m.s$^{-1}$\\
$f$ = frequency in Hz\\
$\lambda$ = wavelength in m 

\begin{wex}
{Speed of longitudinal waves}{The musical note �A� is a sound wave. The note has a frequency of 440 Hz and a wavelength of 0,784~m. Calculate the speed of the musical note.}{
\westep{Determine what is given and what is required}
\begin{eqnarray*}
f &=& 440 \ \rm{Hz} \\
\lambda &=& 0,784\ \rm{m}
\end{eqnarray*}
We need to calculate the speed of the musical note ``A''.

\westep{Determine how to approach based on what is given}
We are given the frequency and wavelength of the note. We can therefore use:
\nequ{v=f\cdot \lambda}

\westep{Calculate the wave speed}
\begin{eqnarray*}
v&=&f\cdot \lambda\\
&=&(440\;\rm{Hz})(0,784\emm)\\
&=&345\ems
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Write the final answer}
The musical note ``A'' travels at 345~\ms.
}
\end{wex}

\begin{wex}
{Speed of longitudinal waves}{A longitudinal wave travels into a medium in which its speed increases.
How does this affect its... (write only \emph{increases, decreases, stays the same}).
\begin{enumerate}
\item period?
\item wavelength?
\end{enumerate}
}{
\westep{Determine what is required}
We need to determine how the period and wavelength of a longitudinal wave change when its speed increases.

\westep{Determine how to approach based on what is given}
We need to find the link between period, wavelength and wave speed.

\westep{Discuss how the period changes}
We know that the frequency of a longitudinal wave is dependent on the frequency of the vibrations that lead to the creation of the longitudinal wave. Therefore, the frequency is always unchanged, irrespective of any changes in speed. Since the period is the inverse of the frequency, the period remains the same.

\westep{Discuss how the wavelength changes}
The frequency remains unchanged. According to the wave equation
\begin{equation*}
v = f\lambda
\end{equation*}
if $f$ remains the same and $v$ increases, then $\lambda$, the wavelength, must also increase.
}
\end{wex}

%\Advanced{Dispersion}{Dispersion is a property of waves where the speed of the wave through a medium depends
%on the frequency. So if two waves enter the same dispersive medium and have different frequencies they will
%have different speeds in that medium even if they both entered with the same speed.}

\section{Graphs of Particle Position, Displacement, Velocity and Acceleration}

When a longitudinal wave moves through the medium, the particles in the medium \textbf{only} move back and forth relative to the direction of motion of the wave. We can see this in Figure~\ref{p:wsl:lw11:motionparticle} which shows the motion of the particles in a medium as a longitudinal wave moves through the medium.

\section{Sound Waves}
Sound waves coming from a tuning fork are caused by the vibrations of the tuning fork which push against the air particles in front of it. As the air particles are pushed together a compression is formed. The particles behind the compression move further apart causing a rarefaction. As the particles continue to push against each other,
the sound wave travels through the air. Due to this motion of the particles, there is a constant variation in the pressure in the air. Sound waves are therefore pressure waves. This means that in media where the particles are closer together, sound waves will travel quicker. 

Sound waves travel faster through liquids, like water, than through the air because water is denser than air (the particles are closer together). Sound waves travel faster in solids than in liquids.

\Tip{A sound wave is different from a light wave. \\
\begin{itemize}
\item{A sound wave is produced by an oscillating object while a light wave is not.}\\
\end{itemize}

Also, because a sound wave is a mechanical wave (i.e. that it needs a medium) it is not capable of traveling through a vacuum, whereas a light wave can travel through a vacuum.}

\Tip{A sound wave is a pressure wave. This means that regions of high pressure (compressions) and low pressure (rarefactions) are created as the sound source vibrates. These compressions and rarefactions arise because the source vibrates longitudinally and the longitudinal motion of air produces pressure fluctuations.}

Sound will be studied in more detail in Chapter~\ref{p:wsl:s11}.

\section{Seismic Waves}
Seismic waves are waves from vibrations in the Earth (core, mantle, oceans). Seismic waves also occur on other planets, for example the moon and can be natural (due to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or meteor strikes) or man-made (due to explosions or anything that hits the earth hard). Seismic P-waves (P for pressure) are longitudinal waves which can travel through solid and liquid. 

\section{Summary - Longitudinal Waves}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A longitudinal wave is a wave where the particles in the medium move parallel to the direction in which the wave is travelling.

\item Longitudinal waves consist of areas of higher pressure, where the particles in the medium are closest together (compressions) and areas of lower pressure, where the particles in the medium are furthest apart (rarefactions).

\item The wavelength of a longitudinal wave is the distance between two consecutive compressions, or two consecutive rarefactions.

\item The relationship between the period ($T$) and frequency ($f$) is given by
$$T = \frac{1}{f} \textnormal{ or } f = \frac{1}{T}.$$

\item The relationship between wave speed ($v$), frequency ($f$) and wavelength ($\lambda$) is given by
$$v = f \lambda.$$

\item Graphs of position vs time, velocity vs time and acceleration vs time can be drawn and are summarised in figures %\ref{}, \ref{} and \ref{}.

\item Sound waves are examples of longitudinal waves. The speed of sound depends on the medium, temperature and pressure. Sound waves travel faster in solids than in liquids, and faster in liquids than in gases. Sound waves also travel faster at higher temperatures and higher pressures.

\section{Introduction}
Now that we have studied the basics of longitudinal waves, we are ready to study sound waves in detail.

Have you ever thought about how amazing your sense of hearing is? It is actually pretty remarkable. There are many types of sounds: a car horn, a laughing baby, a barking dog, and somehow your brain can sort it all out. Though it seems complicated, it is rather simple to understand once you learn a very simple fact. Sound is a wave. So you can use everything you know about waves to explain sound.

\section{Characteristics of a Sound Wave}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to relate the pitch of a sound to the frequency of a sound %wave
%\item The learner must be able to relate the loudness of a sound to both the amplitude of a %sound wave and the sensitivity of the human ear
%\item The learner must be able to relate the quality of a sound to the harmonics that are %superposed in a given sound wave
%\item Notes: The human ear is more sensitive to some frequencies than to others. Loudness %thus depends on both the amplitude of a sound wave and its frequency (whether it lies in a %region where the ear is more or less sensitive).Make a link between the quality of the sound %and the standing waves produced in different musical instruments. The quality of the sound %produced by a particular instrument depends on which harmonics are superposed and in which %proportions.
%\end{syllabus}

Since sound is a wave, we can relate the properties of sound to the properties of a wave. The basic properties of sound are: pitch, loudness and tone.

\caption{Pitch and loudness of sound. Sound B has a \emph{lower} pitch (lower frequency) than Sound A and is \emph{softer} (smaller amplitude) than Sound C.}\label{fig:pitchetc}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Pitch}
The frequency of a sound wave is what your ear understands as pitch. A higher frequency sound has a higher pitch, and a lower frequency sound has a lower pitch. In Figure~\ref{fig:pitchetc} sound A has a higher pitch than sound B. For instance, the chirp of a bird would have a high pitch, but the roar of a lion would have a low pitch.

The human ear can detect a wide range of frequencies. Frequencies from 20 to 20 000 Hz are audible to the human ear. Any sound with a frequency below 20 Hz is known as an \textbf{infrasound} and any sound with a frequency above 20 000 Hz is known as an \textbf{ultrasound}.

Table~\ref{p:wsl:s11:rangeoff} lists the ranges of some common animals compared to humans.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\Activity{Investigation}{Range of Wavelengths}{Using the information given in Table~\ref{p:wsl:s11:rangeoff}, calculate the lower and upper wavelengths that each species can hear. Assume the speed of sound in air is 344~\ms.}

\subsection{Loudness}
The amplitude of a sound wave determines its loudness or volume. A larger amplitude means a louder sound, and a smaller amplitude means a softer sound. In Figure~\ref{fig:pitchetc} sound C is louder than sound B. The vibration of a source sets the amplitude of a wave. It transmits energy into the medium through its vibration. More energetic vibration corresponds to larger amplitude. The molecules move back and forth more vigorously.

The loudness of a sound is also determined by the sensitivity of the ear. The human ear is more sensitive to some frequencies than to others. The volume we receive thus depends on both the amplitude of a sound wave and whether its frequency lies in a region where the ear is more or less sensitive.

\subsection{Tone}
Tone is a measure of the quality of the sound wave. For example, the quality of the sound produced in a particular musical instruments depends on which
harmonics are superposed and in which proportions. The harmonics are determined by the standing waves that are produced in the instrument. Chapter~\ref{p:wsl:pm11} will explain the physics of music in greater detail.

The quality (timbre) of the sound heard depends on the pattern of the incoming vibrations, i.e. the \textit{shape} of the sound wave. The more irregular the vibrations, the more jagged is the shape of the sound wave and the harsher is the sound heard.

\section{Speed of Sound}
The speed of sound depends on the medium the sound is travelling in. Sound travels faster in solids than in liquids, and faster in liquids than in gases. This is because the density of solids is higher than that of liquids which means that the particles are closer together. Sound can be transmitted more easily.

The speed of sound also depends on the temperature of the medium. The hotter the medium is, the faster its particles move and therefore the quicker the sound will travel through the medium. When we heat a substance, the particles in that substance have more kinetic energy and vibrate or move faster. Sound can therefore be transmitted more easily and quickly in hotter substances.

Sound waves are pressure waves. The speed of sound will therefore be influenced by the pressure of the medium through which it is travelling. At sea level the air pressure is higher than high up on a mountain. Sound will travel faster at sea level where the air pressure is higher than it would at places high above sea level.

\Definition{Speed of sound}{The speed of sound in air, at sea level, at a temperature of 21\deg C and under normal atmospheric conditions, is 344~\ms.}

The human ear is divided into three main sections: the outer, middle,
and inner ear. Let's follow the journey of a sound wave from the pinna (outermost part) to the auditory nerve (innermost part) which transmits a signal to the brain. The pinna  is the part of the ear we typically think of when we refer to the ear. Its main
function is to collect and focus an incident sound wave. The wave
then travels through the ear canal until it meets the eardrum. The
pressure fluctuations of the sound wave make the eardrum vibrate.
The three very small bones of the middle ear, the malleus (hammer),
the incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup), transmit the signal through
to the elliptical window. The elliptical window is the beginning of the
inner ear. From the elliptical window the sound waves are transmitted through the liquid
in the inner ear and interpreted as sounds by the brain.
The inner ear, made of the semicircular canals, the cochlea,
and the auditory nerve, is filled with fluid. The fluid allows the body to
detect quick movements and maintain balance. The snail-shaped cochlea
is covered in nerve cells. There are more than 25 000 hairlike
nerve cells. Different nerve cells vibrate with different
frequencies. When a nerve cell vibrates, it releases electrical impulses
to the auditory nerve. The impulses are sent to the brain through the
auditory nerve and understood as sound.

\subsection{Intensity of Sound}
Intensity is one indicator of amplitude. Intensity is the energy transmitted over a unit of area each second.

\Extension{Intensity}{Intensity is defined as:
\nequ{\rm{Intensity}=\frac{\rm{energy}}{\rm{time} \times \rm{area}}=\frac{\rm{power}}{\rm{area}}}

By the definition of intensity, we can see that the units of intensity are
\nequ{\frac{\rm{Joules}}{\mathrm{s \cdot m^{2}}}=\frac{\rm{Watts}}{\rm{m}^{2}}}
}

The unit of intensity is the \textbf{decibel} (symbol: dB). This reduces to an SI equivalent of $\mathrm{W \cdot m^{-2}}$.

The average threshold of hearing is $10^{-12}~\mathrm{W\cdot m^{-2}}$. Below this intensity, the sound is too soft for the ear to hear. The threshold of pain is $1.0~\mathrm{W\cdot m^{-2}}$. Above this intensity a sound is so loud it becomes uncomfortable for
the ear.

Notice that there is a factor of $10^{12}$ between the thresholds of
hearing and pain. This is one reason we define the decibel (dB) scale.

\Extension{dB Scale}{The intensity in dB of a sound of intensity $I$, is given by:
\begin{equation}
\beta =10~\log\frac{I}{I_o} \qquad \qquad {I_o}=10^{-12}~\mathrm{W\cdot m^{-2}}
\end{equation}}

In this way we can compress the whole hearing intensity scale into a
range from 0 dB to 120 dB.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
\caption{Examples of sound intensities.}
\label{p:wsl:s11:intensity}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\hline
\textbf{Source}&\textbf{Intensity} (dB) & \textbf{Times greater than hearing threshold}\\\hline
& & \\
Rocket Launch &180 & $10^{18}$\\
Jet Plane & 140 & $10^{14}$ \\
Threshold of Pain & 120 & $10^{12}$\\
Rock Band & 110 & $10^{11}$\\
Subway Train & 90 & $10^{9}$\\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Notice that there are sounds which exceed the threshold
of pain. Exposure to these sounds can cause immediate damage to hearing.
In fact, exposure to sounds from
80 dB and above can damage hearing over time. Measures
can be taken to avoid damage, such as wearing earplugs
or ear muffs. Limiting exposure time and
increasing distance between you and the source are also
important steps for protecting your hearing.

\Activity{Discussion}{Importance of Safety Equipment}{Working in groups of 5, discuss the importance of safety equipment such as ear protectors for workers in loud environments, e.g. those who use jack hammers or direct aeroplanes to their parking bays. Write up your conclusions in a one page report. Some prior research into the importance of safety equipment might be necessary to complete this group discussion.}

\section{Ultrasound}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to describe sound with frequencies higher than 20 kHz as ultrasound, up to about 100 kHz.
%\item The learner must be able to explain how an image can be created using ultrasound based on the fact that when a wave encounters a boundary between two media, part of the wave is reflected and part is transmitted.
%\item The learner must be able to describe some of the medical benefits and uses of ultrasound, e.g. safety, diagnosis, treatment, pregnancy.
%\item Notes: Make a link to Grade 10, reflection and transmission at a boundary. When an ultrasound wave travels inside an object comprising different materials such as the human body, each time it encounters a boundary, e.g. between bone and muscle, or muscle and fat, part of the wave is reflected and part of it is transmitted. The reflected rays are detected and used to construct an image of the object.
%\end{syllabus}

Ultrasound is sound with a frequency that is higher than 20 kHz. Some animals, such as dogs, dolphins, and bats, have an upper limit that is greater than that of the human ear and can hear ultrasound.

The most common use of ultrasound is to create images, and has industrial and medical applications. The use of ultrasound to create images is based on the reflection and transmission of a wave at a boundary. When an ultrasound wave travels inside an object that is made up of different materials such as the human body, each time it encounters a boundary, e.g. between bone and muscle, or muscle and fat, part of the wave is reflected and part of it is transmitted. The reflected rays are detected and used to construct an image of the object.

Ultrasound in medicine can visualise muscle and soft tissue, making them useful for scanning the organs, and is commonly used during pregnancy. Ultrasound is a safe, non-invasive method of looking inside the human body.

Ultrasound sources may be used to generate local heating in biological tissue, with applications in physical therapy and cancer treatment. Focussed ultrasound sources may be used to break up kidney stones.

Ultrasonic cleaners, sometimes called supersonic cleaners, are used at frequencies from 20-40 kHz for jewellery, lenses and other optical parts, watches, dental instruments, surgical instruments and industrial parts.
These cleaners consist of containers with a fluid in which the object to be cleaned is placed. Ultrasonic waves are then sent into the fluid. The main mechanism for cleaning action in an ultrasonic cleaner is actually the energy released from the collapse of millions of microscopic bubbles occurring in the liquid of the cleaner.

\begin{IFact}{Ultrasound generator/speaker systems are sold with claims that they frighten away rodents and insects, but there is no scientific evidence that the devices work; controlled tests have shown that rodents quickly learn that the speakers are harmless.
}\end{IFact}

%\begin{IFact}
%{Medical ultrasonography was invented in 1953 at Lund University in Sweden by cardiologist Inge Edler and Carl Hellmuth %Hertz, the son of Gustav Ludwig Hertz, who was a graduate student at the department for nuclear physics.}
%\end{IFact}

%\begin{IFact}{In echo-sounding the reflections from ultrasound pulses that are bounced off objects (for example the bottom of the sea, fish etc.) are picked up. The reflections are timed and since their speed is known, the distance to the object can be found. This information can be built into a picture of the object that reflects the ultrasound pulses.}
%\end{IFact}

%In medical scanning, the ultrasound is reflected off each tissue boundary and is picked up. %The reflections are used to build up a picture showing what is inside the body, for example %in pre-natal scans. Some of the ultrasound energy is absorbed by the body, but it is much %less damaging than x-rays.

Ships on the ocean make use of the reflecting properties of sound waves to determine the depth of the ocean. A sound wave is transmitted and bounces off the seabed. Because the speed of sound is known and the time lapse between sending and receiving the sound can be measured, the distance from the ship to the bottom of the ocean can be determined, This is called sonar, which stands from \textbf{So}und \textbf{N}avigation \textbf{A}nd \textbf{R}anging.

\subsection{Echolocation}
Animals like dolphins and bats make use of sounds waves to find their way. Just like ships on the ocean, bats use sonar to navigate. Ultrasound waves that are sent out are reflected off the objects around the animal. Bats, or dolphins, then use the reflected sounds to form a ``picture'' of their surroundings. This is called echolocation.

\begin{wex}{SONAR}
{A ship sends a signal to the bottom of the ocean to determine the depth of the ocean. The speed of sound in sea water is 1450 $\rm{m.s^{-1}}$ If the signal is received 1,5 seconds later, how deep is the ocean at that point?}
{
\westep{Identify what is given and what is being asked:}
\begin{eqnarray*}
s &=& 1450 \ \rm{m.s^{-1}}\\
t &=& 1,5 \ \rm{s} \ \rm{there \ and \ back}\\
\therefore t &= & 0,75 \ \rm{s} \ \rm{one \ way}\\
d &=& ?
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Calculate the distance:}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\rm{Distance} &=& \rm{speed} \times \rm{time} \\

\section{Summary}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Sound waves are longitudinal waves
\item The \textbf{frequency} of a sound is an indication of how high or low the \emph{pitch} of the sound is.
\item The human ear can hear frequencies from 20 to 20~000 Hz. \\
\textbf{Infrasound} waves have frequencies lower than 20 Hz. \\
\textbf{Ultrasound} waves have frequencies higher than 20~000 Hz.
\item The \textbf{amplitude} of a sound determines its \emph{loudness} or volume.
\item The \textbf{tone} is a measure of the \emph{quality} of a sound wave.
\item The speed of sound in air is around 340 m.s$^{-1}$. It is dependent on the temperature, height above sea level and the phase of the medium through which it is travelling.
\item Sound travels faster when the medium is hot.
\item Sound travels faster in a solid than a liquid and faster in a liquid than in a gas.

\section{Introduction}
What is your favorite musical instrument? How do you play it? Do you pluck a string, like a guitar? 
Do you blow through it, like a flute? Do you hit it, like a drum? 
All musical instruments work by making standing waves. Each instrument has a unique sound because of the special waves made in it. 
These waves could be in the strings of a guitar or violin. 
They could also be in the skin of a drum or a tube of air in a trumpet.  
These waves are picked up by the air and later reach your ear as sound.

In Grade 10, you learned about standing waves and boundary conditions. We saw a rope that was:
\begin{itemize}
\item{fixed at both ends}
\item{fixed at one end and free at the other}
\end{itemize}



We also saw a pipe that was:
\begin{itemize}
\item{closed at both ends}
\item{open at both ends}
\item{open at one end, closed at the other}
\end{itemize}

String and wind instruments are good examples of standing waves on strings and pipes.

One way to describe standing waves is to count nodes. 
Recall that a node is a point on a string that does not move as the wave changes. 
The anti-nodes are the highest and lowest points on the wave. There is a node at each end of a fixed string. 
There is also a node at the closed end of a pipe. 
But an open end of a pipe has an anti-node.

What causes a standing wave? There are incident and reflected waves traveling back and forth on our string or pipe. 
For some frequencies, these waves combine in just the right way so that the whole wave appears to be standing still. 
These special cases are called harmonic frequencies, or \textbf{harmonics}. 
They depend on the length and material of the medium.

\Definition{Harmonic}{A \textbf{harmonic} frequency is a frequency at which standing waves can be made in a particular object or on a particular instrument.}

\section{Standing Waves in String Instruments}
Let us look at a basic "instrument": a string pulled tight and fixed at both ends. 
When you pluck the string, you hear a certain pitch. This pitch is made by a certain frequency. 
What causes the string to emit sounds at this pitch?

You have learned that the frequency of a standing wave depends on the length of the wave. 
The wavelength depends on the nodes and anti-nodes.  
The longest wave that can "fit" on the string is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:harmonics}. 
This is called the \textbf{fundamental} or \textbf{natural frequency} of the string. 
The string has nodes at both ends. The wavelength of the fundamental is twice the length of the string.

Now put your finger on the center of the string.  Hold it down gently and pluck it. 
The standing wave now has a node in the middle of the string.  There are three nodes. 
We can fit a whole wave between the ends of the string. 
This means the wavelength is equal to the length of the string.  
This wave is called the first harmonic.  
As we add more nodes, we find the second harmonic, third harmonic, and so on.  
We must keep the nodes equally spaced or we will lose our standing wave.

\item{Use the chart to find a formula for the wavelength in terms of the number of nodes.} \\
\end{enumerate}
}

You should have found this formula:
\nequ{\lambda=\frac{2L}{n-1}}
Here, $n$ is the number of nodes.  $L$ is the length of the
string. The frequency $f$ is:

\nequ{f=\frac{v}{\lambda}}
Here, $v$ is the velocity of the wave. This may seem confusing. 
The wave is a \emph{standing} wave, so how can it have a velocity? 
But one standing wave is made up of many waves that travel back and forth on the string. 
Each of these waves has the same velocity. This speed depends on the mass and tension of the string.

\begin{wex}
{Harmonics on a String}
{We have a standing wave on a string that is 65 cm long. The wave has a velocity of 143 m.s$^{-1}$.  
Find the frequencies of the fundamental, first, second, and third harmonics.}
{
\westep{Identify what is given and what is asked:}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\rm{L} &=& 65 \ \rm{cm} = 0.65 \ \rm{m} \\
v &=& 143 \ \rm{m.s}^{-1} \\
f &=& ?
\end{eqnarray*}
To find the frequency we will use $f = \frac{v}{\lambda}$ \\

\westep{Find the wavelength for each harmonic:}
To find $f$ we need the wavelength of each harmonic ($\lambda = \frac{2L}{n-1}$).
The wavelength is then substituted into $f = \frac{v}{\lambda}$ to find the harmonics. 
The table below shows the calculations.

\begin{center}
%\begin{tabular}{|c|p{0.5cm}|p{0.5cm}|p{0.5cm}|}\hline
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline
\begin{tabular}{c} \ \\ \ \\ \end{tabular} & \textbf{Nodes} & \begin{tabular}{c}\textbf{Wavelength} \\ $\lambda = \frac{2L}{n-1}$ \end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c}\textbf{Frequency}\\$f = \frac{v}{\lambda}$ \end{tabular} \\ \hline
Fundamental frequency $f_{o}$ & 2 & $\frac{2(0,65)}{2-1}$ = 1,3 & $\frac{143}{1,3}$ = 110 Hz \\\hline
First harmonic $f_{1}$ & 3 & $\frac{2(0,65)}{3-1} = 0,65 $ \ \ \  & $\frac{143}{0,65}$ = 220 Hz \\\hline
Second harmonic $f_{2}$ & 4 & $\frac{2(0,65)}{4-1} = 0,43 $ \ \ \ & $\frac{143}{0,43} = 330$ Hz  \\\hline
Third harmonic $f_{3}$ & 5 & $\frac{2(0,65)}{5-1} = 0,33 $ \ \ \ & $\frac{143}{0,33} = 440$ Hz  \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


110 Hz is the natural frequency of the A string on a guitar. 
The third harmonic, at 440 Hz, is the note that orchestras use for tuning.}

\Extension{Guitar}{Guitars use strings with high tension. 
The length, tension and mass of the strings affect the pitches you hear. 
High tension and short strings make high frequencies; low tension and long strings make low frequencies. 
When a string is first plucked, it vibrates at many frequencies. 
All of these except the harmonics are quickly filtered out. The harmonics make up the tone we hear.

The body of a guitar acts as a large wooden soundboard. Here is how a soundboard works: 
the body picks up the vibrations of the strings. It then passes these vibrations to the air. 
A sound hole allows the soundboard of the guitar to vibrate more freely. 
It also helps sound waves to get out of the body.

The neck of the guitar has thin metal bumps on it called frets.  
Pressing a string against a fret shortens the length of that string. 
This raises the natural frequency and the pitch of that string.

Most guitars use an "equal tempered" tuning of 12 notes per octave. 
A 6 string guitar has a range of 4 $\frac{1}{2}$ octaves with pitches from 82.407 Hz (low E) 
to 2093 kHz (high C). Harmonics may reach over 20 kHz, in the inaudible range.

\Extension{Piano}{Let us look at another stringed instrument: the piano. 
The piano has strings that you cannot see. When a key is pressed, a felt-tipped hammer hits a 
string inside the piano. The pitch depends on the length, tension and mass of the string. 
But there are many more strings than keys on a piano. This is because the short and thin 
strings are not as loud as the long and heavy strings.  To make up for this, the higher 
keys have groups of two to four strings each.

The soundboard in a piano is a large cast iron plate. It picks up vibrations 
from the strings. This heavy plate can withstand over 200 tons of pressure from string tension! 
Its mass also allows the piano to sustain notes for long periods
of time.
	
The piano has a wide frequency range, from 27,5 Hz (low A) to 4186,0 Hz 
(upper C). But these are just the fundamental frequencies. A piano plays complex, 
rich tones with over 20 harmonics per note. Some of these are out of the range of human hearing. 
Very low piano notes can be heard mostly because of their higher harmonics.

\section{Standing Waves in Wind Instruments} 
A wind instrument is an instrument that is usually made with a pipe or thin tube. 
Examples of wind instruments are recorders, clarinets, flutes, organs etc.

When one plays a wind instrument, the air that is pushed through the pipe vibrates
and standing waves are formed. Just like with strings, the wavelengths of the standing waves
will depend on the length of the pipe and whether it is open or closed at each end. Let's 
consider each of the following situations:
\begin{itemize}
\item A pipe with both ends open, like a flute or organ pipe.
\item A pipe with one end open and one closed, like a clarinet.
\end{itemize}
If you blow across a small hole in a pipe or reed, it makes a sound. If both ends are open, standing waves
will form according to figure~\ref{fig:musicwaves}. You will notice that there is an anti-node at each end.
In the next activity you will find how this affects the wavelengths.

\item{Use the chart to find a formula for the wavelength in terms of the number of nodes.} \\
\end{enumerate}

The formula is different because there are more anti-nodes than nodes.  The right formula is:

\nequ{\lambda_n=\frac{2L}{n}}
Here, $n$ is still the number of nodes.

{The main frequency of a note is the fundamental frequency. 
The fundamental frequency of the open pipe has one node. 
\westep{To find the frequency we will use the equation:} 
\begin{equation*}
f = \frac{v}{\lambda}
\end{equation*}
We need to find the wavelength first.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lambda &=& \frac{2L}{n} \\
 &=& \frac{2(0,853)}{1} \\

\begin{eqnarray*}
f &=& \frac{v}{\lambda} \\
 &=& \frac{345}{1,706} \\

This is lower than  262 Hz, so this pipe will not play middle C.  We will need a shorter pipe for a higher pitch.}

\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
A flute can be modeled as a metal pipe open at both ends.  (One end looks closed but the flute has 
an \emph{embouchure}, or hole for the player to blow across. 
This hole is large enough for air to escape on that side as well.)  
If the fundamental note of a flute is middle C (262 Hz) , how long
is the flute? The speed of sound in air is 345 m.s$^{-1}$.

Now let's look at a pipe that is open on one end and closed on the other.
This pipe has a node at one end and an antinode at the other. An example of a musical
instrument that has a node at one end and an antinode at the other is a clarinet. In the 
activity you will find out how the wavelengths are affected.

The right formula for this pipe is:

\nequ{\lambda_n=\frac{4L}{2n-1}}

A long wavelength has a low frequency and low pitch. If you took your pipe from the last example and covered one end, you should hear a much lower note!  Also, the wavelengths of the harmonics for this tube are \emph{not} integer multiples of each other.

\begin{wex}
{The Clarinet}
{A clarinet can be modeled as a wooden pipe closed on one end and open on the other. The player blows into a small slit on one end. A reed then vibrates in the mouthpiece. This makes the standing wave in the air. What is the fundamental frequency of a clarinet 60 cm long? The speed of sound in air is 345 m.s$^{-1}$.}
{
\westep{Identify what is given and what is asked:}
We are given:
\begin{eqnarray*}
L &=& 60 \ \rm{cm}\\
v &=& 345 \ \rm{m.s^{-1}} \\
f &=& ?
\end{eqnarray*}    

\westep{To find the frequency we will use the equation $f=\frac{v}{\lambda}$
but we need to find the wavelength first:}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\lambda &=& \frac{4L}{2n-1}\\
 &=& \frac{4(0,60)}{2(1)-1} \\
 &=& 2,4 \ \rm{m}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Now, using the wavelength you have calculated, find the frequency:}
\begin{eqnarray*}
f &=& \frac{v}{\lambda}\\
  &=& \frac{345}{2,4} \\
  &=& 144 \ \rm{Hz}
\end{eqnarray*}

This is closest to the D below middle C. This note is one of the lowest notes on a clarinet.

\end{wex}

\Extension{Musical Scale}{The 12 tone scale popular in Western music took centuries to develop. This scale is also called the 12-note Equal Tempered scale. It has an octave divided into 12 steps.  (An \textbf{octave} is the main interval of most scales. If you double a frequency, you have raised the note one octave.)  All steps have equal ratios of frequencies. But this scale is not perfect. If the octaves are in tune, all the other intervals are slightly mistuned.  No interval is badly out of tune.  But none is perfect.

For example, suppose the base note of a scale is a frequency of
110 Hz ( a low A). The first harmonic is 220 Hz.  This note is
also an A, but is one octave higher.  The second harmonic is at
330 Hz (close to an E). The third is 440 Hz (also an A).  But
not all the notes have such simple ratios.  Middle C has a frequency of about 262 Hz.  This is not a simple multiple of 110 Hz. So the interval between C and A is a little out of tune.

Many other types of tuning exist.  Just Tempered scales are tuned
so that all intervals are simple ratios of frequencies. 
There are also equal tempered scales with more or less notes
per octave.  Some scales use as many as  31 or 53 notes.}

\section{Resonance}
Resonance is the tendency of a system to vibrate at a maximum amplitude at the natural frequency
of the system. 

Resonance takes place when a system is made to vibrate at its natural frequency as a result of vibrations
that are received from another source of the same frequency. In the following investigation you will
measure the speed of sound using resonance. 

\Activity{Experiment}{Using resonance to measure the speed of sound}
{
\Aim{ To measure the speed of sound using resonance}
\Apparatus{
\begin{itemize}
\item one measuring cylinder
\item a high frequency (512 Hz) tuning fork 
\item some water
\item a ruler or tape measure
\end{itemize}}

\Method{ 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make the tuning fork vibrate by hitting it on the sole of your shoe or something else that has a rubbery texture.
A hard surface is not ideal as you can more easily damage the tuning fork. Be careful to hold the tuning fork by its handle. Don't touch the fork because it will damp the vibrations. \label{step:res1}

\item Hold the vibrating tuning fork about 1 cm above the cylinder mouth and start adding water to the cylinder 
at the same time. Keep doing this until the first resonance occurs. Pour out or add a little water until you find the level
at which the loudest sound (i.e. the resonance) is made.\label{step:res2} 

\item When the water is at the resonance level, use a ruler or tape measure to measure the distance ($L_{A}$) between the top of the cylinder 
and the water level.\label{step:res3}

\item Repeat the steps~\ref{step:res1-step:res1} above, this time adding more water until you find the next resonance.
Remember to hold the tuning fork at the same height of about 1 cm above the cylinder mouth and adjust the water level 
to get the loudest sound. 

\item Use a ruler or tape measure to find the new distance ($L_{B}$) from the top of the cylinder to the new water level. 
\end{enumerate}}
\Conclusions{
The difference between the two resonance water levels (i.e. $L = L_{A}-L_{B}$) is half a wavelength, or the same as 
the distance between a compression and rarefaction. Therefore, since you know the wavelength, and you know the frequency
of the tuning fork, it is easy to calculate the speed of sound!}

{A 512 Hz tuning fork can produce a resonance in a cavity where the air column is 18,2 cm long. It can also produce
a second resonance when the length of the air column is 50,1 cm. What is the speed of sound in the cavity?}
{
\westep{Identify what is given and what is asked:}

Remember that:

We have values for $f$ and so to calculate $v$, we need to first find $\lambda$.
You know that the difference in the length of the air column between two resonances is half a wavelength.

\begin{eqnarray*}

So,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lambda &=& 2 \times 32,1 \ \rm{cm} \\
 &=& 64,2 \ \rm{cm} \\
 &=& 0,642 \ \rm{m}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Now you can substitute into the equation for $v$ to find the speed of sound:}
\begin{eqnarray*}
v &=& f \times \lambda \\
 &=& 512 \times 0,642 \\
 &=& 328,7 \ \rm{m.s}^{-1}
\end{eqnarray*}
}
\end{wex}

From the investigation you will notice that the column of air will make a sound at a certain length. 
This is where resonance takes place.

\section{Music and Sound Quality}
In the sound chapter, we referred to the quality of sound as its
tone.  What makes the tone of a note played on an instrument? 
When you pluck a string or vibrate air in a tube, you hear mostly the fundamental frequency. Higher harmonics are present, but are fainter. These are called \textbf{overtones}.  The tone of a note depends on its mixture of overtones.  Different instruments have different
mixtures of overtones.  This is why the same note sounds
different on a flute and a piano.

Let us see how overtones can change the shape of a wave:

\end{pspicture}
\end {center}
\caption{The quality of a tone depends on its mixture of
harmonics.}
\label{sound:wave}
\end{figure}

The resultant waveform is very different from the fundamental
frequency.  Even though the two waves have the same main
frequency, they do not sound the same!

\section{Summary - The Physics of Music}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Instruments produce sound because they form standing waves in strings or pipes.
\item The fundamental frequency of a string or a pipe is its natural frequency. The wavelength
of the fundamental frequency is twice the length of the string or pipe when both ends are fixed or both ends are open. It is four times the length of the pipe when one end is closed and one end is open.
\item When the string is fixed at both ends, or the pipe is open at both ends the first harmonic is formed when the standing wave forms one whole
wavelength in the string or pipe. The second harmonic is formed when the 
standing wave forms 1$\frac{1}{2}$ wavelengths in the string or pipe.
\item When a pipe is open at one end and closed at the other, the first harmonic is formed when the standing wave forms $\frac{11}{3}$ wavelengths in the pipe.
\item The frequency of a wave can be calculated with the equation $f = \frac{v}{\lambda}$.
\item The wavelength of a standing wave in a string fixed at both ends can be calculated using
$\lambda_{n} = \frac{2L}{n-1}$.
\item The wavelength of a standing wave in a pipe with both ends open can be calculated using
$\lambda_{n} = \frac{2L}{n}$.
\item The wavelength of a standing wave in a pipe with one end open can be calculated using
$\lambda_{n} = \frac{4L}{2n-1}$.
\item Resonance takes place when a system is made to vibrate at its natural frequency as a 
result of vibrations received from another source of the same frequency.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Electrostatics - Grade 11}
\label{p:em:es11}

\section{Introduction}
In Grade 10, you learnt about the force between charges. In this
chapter you will learn exactly how to determine this force and
about a basic law of electrostatics.



\section{Forces between charges - Coulomb's Law}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item State Coulomb's Law (in words and mathematically)
%\item Solve problems using Coulomb's Law to calculate the force exerted on a charge by one or more charges in one dimension.
%\item Solve problems using Coulomb's Law to calculate the force exerted on a charge by one or more charges in two dimensions
%\item Note: Here is another context in which to apply superposition - the forces exerted on a charge due to several other charges can be superposed to find the net force acting on the charge. Make a link to Grade 11 Mechanics. Get learners to draw free body diagrams showing the forces acting on charges. Also link to N3-- two charges exert forces of equal magnitude on one another in opposite directions. When substituting into the Coulomb's Law equation, it is not necessary to include the signs of the charges. Instead, select a positive direction. Then forces that tend to move the charge in this direction are added, while forces that act in the opposite direction are subtracted. Make a link with Grade 11 Mechanics, Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. The two equations have the same form. They both represent the force exerted by particles (masses or charges) on each other that interact by means of a field.
%\end{syllabus}

Like charges repel each other while opposite charges attract each other. If the charges are at rest then the force between
them is known as the \textbf{electrostatic force}. The
electrostatic force between charges increases when the magnitude
of the charges increases or the distance between the charges
decreases.\\
 
The electrostatic force was first studied in detail by
Charles Coulomb around 1784. Through his observations he was able
to show that the electrostatic force between two point-like
charges is inversely proportional to the square of the distance
between the objects. He also discovered that the force is
proportional to the product of the charges on the two objects. That is:\\
 
\begin{eqnarray*}
F \propto \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2},
\end{eqnarray*}
where $Q_1$ is the charge on the one point-like object, $Q_2$ is
the charge on the second, and $r$ is the distance between the two.
The magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point-like
charges is given by \textit{Coulomb's Law}.\\
 
\Definition{Coulomb's Law}{Coulomb's Law states that the
magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point charges is
directly proportional to the magnitudes of each charge and
inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the
charges:

\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:Coulomb-force} F = k \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}
\end{equation*}
The proportionality constant $k$ is called the
\textit{electrostatic constant} and has the value:

\begin{equation*}
k=8,99\times 10^9 {\rm N\cdot m^2 \cdot C^{-2}.}
\end{equation*}}

\Extension{Similarity of Coulomb's Law to Newton's Universal Law
of Gravitation.}{Notice how similar Coulomb's Law is to the form
of Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation between two point-like
particles:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_G=G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2},
\end{eqnarray*}
where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two particles, $r$ is
the distance between them, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.

Both laws represent the force exerted by particles (masses or
charges) on each other that interact by means of a field.\\

\begin{wex}{Coulomb's Law I}
{Two point-like charges carrying charges of $+3\times 10^{-9}{\rm
C}$ and $-5\times 10^{-9}{\rm C}$ are $2\emm$ apart. Determine the
magnitude of the force between them and state whether it is
attractive or repulsive.} { \westep{Determine what is required} We
are required to find the force between two point charges given the
charges and the distance between them.

\westep{Determine how to approach the problem} We can use
Coulomb's Law to find the force. \nequ{F = k \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}}

\westep{Determine what is given} We are given:
\begin{itemize}
\item{$Q_1=+3\times 10^{-9}{\rm C}$}
\item{$Q_2=-5\times 10^{-9}{\rm C}$}
\item{$r=2\emm$}
\end{itemize}
We know that $k=8,99\times 10^9 {\rm N\cdot m^2 \cdot C^{-2}}$.\\
 
We can draw a diagram of the situation.

we have

F &=& k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}\\
&=& (8,99\times10^{9} {\rm N\cdot m^2/C^2}) \frac{(3\times 10^{-9}{\rm C})(5\times 10^{-9}{\rm C})}{(2 {\rm m})^2}\\
&=& 3,37\times10^{-8} \rm N
\end{eqnarray*}

Thus the {\em magnitude} of the force is
$3,37\times10^{-8}\rm{N}$. However since both point charges have
opposite signs, the force will be attractive.}
\end{wex}

Next is another example that demonstrates the difference in
magnitude between the gravitational force and the electrostatic
force.

\begin{wex}{Coulomb's Law II}

two electrons $10^{-10}\rm{m}$ apart (i.e. the forces felt inside an atom).}
{ \westep{Determine what is required} We are required to calculate
the electrostatic and gravitational forces between two electrons,
a given distance apart.

\westep{Determine how to approach the problem} We can use:
\nequ{F_e = k \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}} to calculate the electrostatic
force and \nequ{F_g = G \frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}} to calculate the gravitational force.

\item{$m_1=m_2=9,1 \times 10^{-31}\ekg$(The mass of an electron)}
\item{$r=1\times10^{-10}\rm{m}$}
\end{itemize}
We know that:
\begin{itemize}
\item{$k=8,99\times 10^9\; \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 \cdot C^{-2}}$}
\item{$G=6,67\times 10^{-11}\;\mathrm{N \cdot m^2 \cdot kg^{-2}}$}
\end{itemize}
All quantities are in SI units.\\
 
We can draw a diagram of the situation.

\frac{(-1,60\times10^{-19})(-1,60\times10^{-19})}{(10^{-10})^2}\\
&=&2,30\times10^{-8}\;\rm N
\end{eqnarray*}

Hence the {\em magnitude} of the electrostatic force between the
electrons is $2,30\times10^{-8}\rm N$. Since electrons carry the
same charge, the force is repulsive.

\westep{Calculate the gravitational force}

\begin{eqnarray*}
F_g&=&G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}\\
&=&(6,67\times10^{-11}{\rm N\cdot m^2/kg^2})\frac{(9.11\times10^{-31}{\rm C}) (9.11\times10^{-31}{\rm kg})}{(10^{-10}{\rm m})^2}\\
&=&5,54\times10^{-51}{\rm N}
\end{eqnarray*}

The magnitude of the gravitational force between the electrons is
$5,54\times10^{-51}\rm N$. This is an attractive force.\\
 
Notice that the gravitational force between the electrons is much
smaller than the electrostatic force. For this reason, the
gravitational force is usually neglected when determining the
force between two charged objects.}

We mentioned in Chapter~\ref{p:em:es10} that charge placed on a
spherical conductor spreads evenly along the surface. As a result,
if we are far enough from the charged sphere, electrostatically,
it behaves as a point-like charge. Thus we can treat spherical
conductors (e.g. metallic balls) as point-like charges, with all
the charge acting at the centre.

{How are we going to determine the charge on X? Well, if we know

\westep{Calculate the magnitude of the electrostatic force, $F_E$}
Since nothing is moving (system is in equilibrium) the vertical
and horizontal components of the gravitational force must cancel the vertical and horizontal components of the electrostatic force. Thus

\begin{eqnarray*}
F_E=T\cos(60^{\circ});\qquad\qquad F_g=T\sin(60^{\circ}).
\end{eqnarray*}
The only force we know is the gravitational force $F_g=mg$. Now we
can calculate the magnitude of $T$ from above:

\begin{eqnarray*}
T=\frac{F_g}{\sin(60^{\circ})}=\frac{(10)(10)}{\sin(60^ {\circ})}=115,5{\rm N}.
\end{eqnarray*}
Which means that $F_E$ is:

\nequ{ F_E=T\cos(60^{\circ})=115,5 \cdot
\cos(60^{\circ})=57,75\rm N }

\westep{} Now that we know the magnitude of the electrostatic
force between X and Y, we can calculate their charges using
Coulomb's Law. Don't forget that the magnitudes of the charges on
X and Y are the same: $Q_{\rm X}=Q_{\rm Y}$. The magnitude of
the electrostatic force is

\begin{eqnarray*}
F_E &=& k\frac{Q_{\rm X}Q_{\rm Y}}{r^2}= k\frac{Q_{\rm X}^2}{r^2}\\
% \therefor
Q_{\rm X}&=&\sqrt{\frac{F_E r^2}{k}}\\
&=&\sqrt{\frac{(57.75)(0.5)^2}{8.99\times10^{9}}}\\

Thus the charge on X is $-5.66\times10^{-5}{\rm C}$.}

%\item Draw electric field lines for various configurations of charges.
%\item Define the magnitude of the electric field at a point as the force per unit charge (E = F/q). E and F are vectors.
%\item Deduce that the force acting on a charge in an electric field is F = Eq
%\item Calculate the electric field at a point due to a number of point charges, using the equation E=kQ/r.r to determine the contribution to the field due to each charge.
%\item Note: Here is another opportunity to discuss field, one of the big ideas. Discuss the fact that electric field lines, like magnetic field lines (see Grade 10), are a way of representing the electric field at a point. Arrows on the field lines indicate the direction of the field, i.e. the direction a positive test charge would move. Electric field lines therefore point away from positive charges and towards negative charges. Field lines are drawn closer together where the field is stronger. Also, the number of field lines passing through a surface is proportional to the charge enclosed by the surface.The electric fields due to a number of charges can be superposed. As with Coulomb's Law calculations, do not substitute the sign of the charge into the equation for electric field. Instead, choose a positive direction, and then either add or subtract the contribution to the electric field due to each charge depending upon whether it points in the positive or negative direction, respectively.

We have learnt that objects that carry charge feel forces from all
other charged objects. It is useful to determine what the effect
from a charge would be at every point surrounding it. To do this we
need some sort of reference. We know that the force that one
charge feels due to another depends on both charges ($Q_1$ and
$Q_2$). How then can we talk about forces if we only have one
charge? The solution to this dilemma is to introduce a \emph{test
charge}. We then determine the force that would be exerted on it
if we placed it at a certain location. If we do this for every
point surrounding a charge we know what would happen if we put a
test charge at any location.\\
 
This map of what would happen at any point is called an electric field map. It
is a map of the electric field \emph{due to} a charge. It tells us, at each point in space,
how large the force on a test charge would be and in what
direction the force would be. Our map consists of the vectors that
describe the force on the test charge if it were placed there.

\Definition{Electric field}{A collection of electric charges gives rise to a 'field of vectors' in the surrounding region of space, called an \textbf{electric field}. The direction of
the electric field at a point is the direction that a positive
test charge would move if placed at that point.}

\subsection{Electric field lines}
The electric field maps depend very much on the charge or charges that the map is
being made for. We will start off with the simplest possible case.
Take a single positive charge with no other charges around it.
First, we will look at what effects it would have on a test charge
at a number of points.\\
 
Electric field lines, like the magnetic field lines that were
studied in Grade 10, are a way of representing the electric field
at a point. 
\begin {itemize}
\item Arrows on the field lines indicate the direction of
the field, i.e. the direction a positive test charge would move.
\item Electric field lines therefore point away from positive charges
and towards negative charges. 
\item Field lines are drawn closer
together where the field is stronger. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Positive charge acting on a test charge}
At each point we calculate the force on a test charge, $q$, and
represent this force by a vector.

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-3.3,-3.3)(3.3,3.3)
%\psgrid
\pscircle(0,0){.6} \rput(0,0){+Q} \SpecialCoor
\def\arrlines{\psline{->}(0.6;0)(1.6;0)
\psline{->}(2;0)(2.5;0) \psline{->}(3;0)(3.3;0)} \degrees[1.2]
\multido{\n=0.0+.1}{12}{%
\rput{\n}{\arrlines}}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

We can see that at every point the positive test charge, $q$,
would experience a force pushing it away from the charge, $Q$.
This is because both charges are positive and so they repel. Also
notice that at points further away the vectors are shorter. That
is because the force is smaller if you are further away. 

\subsubsection{Negative charge acting on a test charge}
If the charge, Q, were negative we would have the following result.
\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-3.3,-3.3)(3.3,3.3)
%\psgrid
\pscircle(0,0){.6} \rput(0,0){-Q} \SpecialCoor
\def\arrlines{\psline{<-}(0.6;0)(1.6;0)
\psline{<-}(2;0)(2.5;0) \psline{<-}(3;0)(3.3;0)} \degrees[1.2]
\multido{\n=0.0+.1}{12}{%
\rput{\n}{\arrlines}}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

Notice that it is \textbf{almost} identical to the positive charge
case. This is important -- the arrows are the same length because
the magnitude of the charge is the same and so is the magnitude of
the test charge. Thus the \textbf{magnitude} (size) of the force is the
same. The arrows point in the opposite direction because the
charges now have opposite sign and so the positive test charge is
\textbf{attracted} to the charge. Now, to make things simpler, we
draw continuous lines showing the path that the test charge would
travel. This means we don't have to work out the magnitude of the
force at many different points.

\subsubsection{Electric field map due to a positive charge}

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-2.6,-2.6)(2.6,2.6)

\degrees[1.2]
\multido{\n=0.0+.1}{12}{%
\rput{\n}{\arrlines}}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

\textbf{Some important points to remember about electric fields:}
\begin{itemize}
\item There is an electric field at \textbf{every point} in space
surrounding a charge.
\item Field lines are merely a \textbf{representation} -- they are not
real. When we draw them, we just pick convenient places to
indicate the field in space.
\item Field lines usually start at a \textbf{right-angle} ($90^o$) to the
charged object causing the field.
\item Field lines \textbf{never} cross.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Combined charge distributions}
We will now look at the field of a positive charge and a negative charge
placed next to each other. The net resulting field would be the
addition of the fields from each of the charges. To start off with
let us sketch the field maps for each of the charges separately.

\subsubsection{Electric field of a negative and a positive charge in isolation}

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-5.4,-2.6)(5.4,2.6)
%\psgrid
\rput(-2.8,0){\pscircle(0,0){.6} \rput(0,0){+Q} \SpecialCoor

\degrees[1.2]
\multido{\n=0.0+.1}{12}{%
\rput{\n}{\arrlines}}}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}


Notice that a test charge starting off directly between the two
would be pushed away from the positive charge and pulled towards
the negative charge in a straight line. The path it would follow
would be a straight line between the charges.

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-3,-1)(9,1)


\cnode[](0,0){.6}{mycircle} \rput(0,0){+Q}

\psline{->}(0.6,0)(5.4,0) \cnode[](6,0){.6}{mycircle}
\rput(6,0){-Q}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}
Now let's consider a test charge starting off a bit higher than
directly between the charges. If it starts closer to the positive
charge the force it feels from the positive charge is greater, but
the negative charge also attracts it, so it would experience a force away from
the positive charge with a tiny force attracting it towards the
negative charge. If it were a bit further from the positive charge the
force from the negative and positive charges change and in fact they would be
equal in magnitude if the forces were at equal distances from the charges. After that
point the negative charge starts to exert a stronger force on the
test charge. This means that the test charge would move towards the
negative charge with only a small force away from the positive
charge.

\begin{center}

\subsubsection{Two like charges : both positive}
For the case of two positive charges things look a little
different. We can't just turn the arrows around the way we did
before. In this case the test charge is repelled by both charges.
This tells us that a test charge will never cross half way because
the force of repulsion from both charges will be equal in
magnitude.

\end{center}

The field directly between the charges cancels out in the middle.
The force has equal magnitude and opposite direction. Interesting
things happen when we look at test charges that are not on a line
directly between the two.

We know that a charge the same distance below the middle will
experience a force along a reflected line, because the problem is
symmetric (i.e. if we flipped vertically it would look the same).
This is also true in the horizontal direction. So we use this fact
to easily draw in the next four lines.

\subsubsection{Two like charges : both negative}
We can use the fact that the direction of the force is reversed
for a test charge if you change the sign of the charge that is
influencing it. If we change to the case where both charges are
negative we get the following result:

\subsection{Parallel plates}
One very important example of electric fields which is used
extensively is the electric field between two charged parallel
plates. In this situation the electric field is constant. This is
used for many practical purposes and later we will explain how
Millikan used it to measure the charge on the electron.

\subsubsection{Field map for oppositely charged parallel plates}

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(0,0)(6.6,4.5)
\psset{xunit=.66cm} \psset{yunit=.66cm}
\psframe[dimen=inner](0.2,6.0)(9.8,6.8)
\psframe[dimen=inner](0.2,.2)(9.8,1)
\pscurve{<-}(0.2,1)(-.2,3.5)(0.2,6.)
\pscurve{<-}(9.8,1)(10.2,3.5)(9.8,6.)
\multido{\n=0.0+1}{9}{%
\rput(\n,0){\psline{<-}(1,1)(1,6) \rput(1,6.4){+} \rput(1,.6){-}}
}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}
This means that the force that a test charge would feel at any
point between the plates would be identical in magnitude and
direction. The fields on the edges exhibit fringe effects,
\emph{i.e. they bulge outwards}. This is because a test charge
placed here would feel the effects of charges only on one side
(either left or right depending on which side it is placed). Test
charges placed in the middle experience the effects of charges on
both sides so they balance the components in the horizontal
direction. This is clearly not the case on the edges.

\subsubsection{Strength of an electric field}
When we started making field maps we drew arrows to indicate the
strength of the field and the direction. When we moved to lines
you might have asked ``Did we forget about the field strength?''.
We did not. Consider the case for a single positive charge again:

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-3,-3)(3,3)
\cnode[](0,0){.6}{mycircle} \rput(0,0){+Q} \degrees[1.2]
\multido{\n=0.0+.1}{12}{%
\rput{\n}{\psline{->}(0.6,0)(2.6,0)}}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

Notice that as you move further away from the charge the field
lines become more spread out. In field map diagrams, the closer together
field lines are, the stronger the field. Therefore, the electric field is stronger closer to the charge (the electric field lines are closer together) and weaker further from the charge (the electric field lines are further apart).\\
 
The magnitude of the electric field at a point as the force per
unit charge. Therefore,
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{F}{q}
\end{equation*}
E and F are vectors. From this we see that the force on a charge
$q$ is simply:
\begin{equation*}
F=E \cdot q
\end{equation*}

The force between two electric charges is given by:
\begin{equation*}
F=k\frac{Qq}{r^2}.
\end{equation*} (if we make the one charge $Q$ and the other $q$.)
Therefore, the electric field can be written as:
\begin{equation*}
E=k\frac{Q}{r^2}
\end{equation*}
The electric field is the force per unit of charge and hence has
units of newtons per coulomb.

As with Coulomb's law calculations, do not substitute the sign of
the charge into the equation for electric field. Instead, choose a
positive direction, and then either add or subtract the
contribution to the electric field due to each charge depending
upon whether it points in the positive or negative direction,
respectively.

The \textit{electrical potential energy} of a charge is the energy
it has because of its position relative to other charges that it
interacts with. The potential energy of a charge $Q_1$ relative to
a charge $Q_2$ a distance $r$ away is calculated by:\\
\begin{equation*}
U=\frac{kQ_1Q_2}{r}
\end{equation*}

\end{wex}

\subsection{Electrical potential}
The electrical potential at a point is the electrical potential
energy per unit charge, i.e. the potential energy a positive test
charge would have if it were placed at that point.\\
 
Consider a positive test charge $+Q$ placed at A in the electric
field of another positive point charge.

\begin{center}

\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

The test charge moves towards B under the influence of the
electric field of the other charge.
In the process the test charge loses electrical potential energy
and gains kinetic energy. Thus, at A, the test charge has more
potential energy than at B -- {\bf A is said to have a higher
electrical potential than B}. \\
 
The potential energy of a charge at
a point in a field is defined as the work required to move that
charge from infinity to that point.

\Definition {Potential difference}{The {\bf potential difference between two points} in an electric
field is defined as the {\bf work required to move a unit positive
test charge from the point of lower potential to that of higher
potential}.}
If an amount of work $W$ is required to move a charge
$Q$ from one point to another, then the potential difference
between the two points is given by,

\begin{eqnarray}
V &=&{W\over Q}\nonumber\hspace{2cm}
\mathrm{unit:J.C^{-1}\;or\;V\;(the\;volt)}
\end{eqnarray}

From this equation we can define the volt.

\Definition {The Volt}{One volt is the potential
difference between two points in an electric field if one joule of
work is done in moving one coulomb of charge from the one point to
the other.}

\subsection{Real-world application: lightning}

Lightning is an atmospheric discharge of electricity, usually, but
not always, during a rain storm. An understanding of lightning is
important for power transmission lines as engineers need to
know about lightning in order to adequately protect lines and
equipment.
\Extension {Formation of lightning}{
\begin {enumerate} 
\item \textbf{Charge separation}\\
The first process in the generation of lightning is charge separation.
The mechanism by which charge separation happens is still the subject of research. 
One theory is that opposite charges are driven apart and energy is stored in the
electric field between them. Cloud electrification appears to require strong
updrafts which carry water droplets upward, supercooling them to $-10$ to 
$-20$~$^{\circ}$C. These collide with ice crystals to form a soft ice-water
mixture called graupel. The collisions result in a slight positive charge being
transferred to ice crystals, and a slight negative charge to the graupel.
Updrafts drive lighter ice crystals upwards, causing the cloud top to accumulate
increasing positive charge. The heavier negatively charged graupel falls towards
the middle and lower portions of the cloud, building up an increasing negative
charge. Charge separation and accumulation continue until the electrical
potential becomes sufficient to initiate lightning discharges, which occurs when
the gathering of positive and negative charges forms a sufficiently strong
electric field.\\ 
 
\item \textbf{Leader formation}\\
As a thundercloud moves over the Earth's surface, an equal but opposite charge
is induced in the Earth below, and the induced ground charge follows the
movement of the cloud. 
An initial bipolar discharge, or path of ionized air, starts from a negatively
charged mixed water and ice region in the thundercloud. The discharge ionized
channels are called leaders. The negative charged leaders, called a "stepped
leader", proceed generally downward in a number of quick jumps, each up to 50
metres long. Along the way, the stepped leader may branch into a number of paths
as it continues to descend. The progression of stepped leaders takes a
comparatively long time (hundreds of milliseconds) to approach the ground. This
initial phase involves a relatively small electric current (tens or hundreds of
amperes), and the leader is almost invisible compared to the subsequent
lightning channel. 
When a step leader approaches the ground, the presence of opposite charges on
the ground enhances the electric field. The electric field is highest on trees
and tall buildings. If the electric field is strong enough, a conductive
discharge (called a positive streamer) can develop from these points. As the
field increases, the positive streamer may evolve into a hotter, higher current
leader which eventually connects to the descending stepped leader from the
cloud. It is also possible for many streamers to develop from many different
objects at the same time, with only one connecting with the leader and forming the
main discharge path. Photographs have been taken on which non-connected
streamers are clearly visible. When the two leaders meet, the electric current
greatly increases. The region of high current propagates back up the positive
stepped leader into the cloud with a "return stroke" that is the most luminous
part of the lightning discharge.\\
\item \textbf{Discharge}
When the electric field becomes strong enough, an electrical discharge (the bolt
of lightning) occurs within clouds or between clouds and the ground. During the
strike, successive portions of air become a conductive discharge channel as the
electrons and positive ions of air molecules are pulled away from each other and
forced to flow in opposite directions. 
The electrical discharge rapidly superheats the discharge channel, causing the
air to expand rapidly and produce a shock wave heard as thunder. The rolling and
gradually dissipating rumble of thunder is caused by the time delay of sound
coming from different portions of a long stroke.  
\end{enumerate}}

Estimating distance of a lightning strike. The flash of a
lightning strike and resulting thunder occur at roughly the same
time. But light travels at 300~000 kilometres in a second, almost
a million times the speed of sound. Sound travels at the slower
speed of 330~m/s in the same time, so the flash of lightning is
seen before thunder is heard. By counting the seconds between the
flash and the thunder and dividing by 3, you can estimate your
distance from the strike and initially the actual storm cell (in
kilometres).

Since one plate stores positive charge and the other stores negative charge, the total charge on the two plates is zero. When a dielectric is inserted between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor the dielectric becomes polarised so an electric field is induced in the dielectric that opposes the field between the plates. When the two electric fields are superposed, the new field between the plates becomes smaller. Thus the voltage between the plates decreases so the capacitance increases.

\subsection{Capacitors and capacitance}

A parallel plate capacitor is a device that consists of two
oppositely charged conducting plates separated by a small
distance, which stores charge. When voltage is applied to the
capacitor, usually by connecting it to an energy source (e.g. a battery) in a circuit, electric charge of equal magnitude, but opposite
polarity, builds up on each plate.\\

\Definition{Capacitance}{Capacitance is the charge stored per volt
and is measured in Farads (F).}

Mathematically, capacitance is the ratio of the charge on a single
plate to the voltage across the plates of the capacitor:
\nequ{C=\frac{Q}{V}.}\\
 
Capacitance is measured in Farads (F).  Since capacitance is defined
as $C=\frac{Q}{V}$, the units are in terms of charge over
potential difference. The unit of charge is the coulomb and the
unit of the potential difference is the volt.  One farad is
therefore the capacitance if one coulomb of charge was stored on a
capacitor for every volt applied.\\
 
1~C of charge is a very large amount of charge.  So, for a small
amount of voltage applied, a 1~F capacitor can store a enormous
amount of charge. Therefore, capacitors are often denoted in terms
of microfarads ($1\times10^{-6}$), nanofarads ($1\times10^{-9}$),
or  picofarads ($1\times10^{-12}$).

\Tip{$Q$ is the magnitude of the charge stored on either
plate, not on both plates added together. Since one plate stores
positive charge and the other stores negative charge, the total
charge on the two plates is zero.}

\begin{wex}{Capacitance}{Suppose that a 5 V battery is connected in a circuit to
a 5~pF capacitor.  After the battery has been connected for a long time, what is
the charge stored on each of the plates?}
{To begin remember that after a voltage has been applied for a
long time the capacitor is fully charged. The relation between
voltage and the maximum charge of a capacitor is found in equation
~\ref{eq:cap}. \nequ{CV =  Q}

Inserting the given values of $C=5 {\rm F}$ and $V= 5 {\rm V}$, we find that:

\begin{eqnarray*}
Q &=& CV \\
 &=& (5\times10^{-12}F)(5V) \\
& = & 2,5\times10^{-11}C
\end{eqnarray*}

}
\end{wex}

\subsection{Dielectrics}
The electric field between the plates of a capacitor is affected by the substance between them. The substance between the plates is called a dielectric. Common substances used as dielectrics are mica, perspex, air, paper and glass.\\
When a dielectric is inserted between the plates of a parallel
plate capacitor the dielectric becomes polarised so an electric
field is induced in the dielectric that opposes the field between
the plates. When the two electric fields are superposed, the new
field between the plates becomes smaller. Thus the voltage between
the plates decreases so the capacitance increases.\\
 
In every capacitor, the dielectric stops the charge on one plate
from travelling to the other plate.  However, each capacitor is
different in how much charge it allows to build up on the
electrodes per voltage applied.  When scientists started studying
capacitors they discovered the property that the voltage applied
to the capacitor was proportional to the maximum charge that would
accumulate on the electrodes.  The constant that made this
relation into an equation was called the capacitance, C. The
capacitance was different for different capacitors. But, it stayed
constant no matter how much voltage was applied.  So, it predicts
how much charge will be stored on a capacitor when different
voltages are applied.

\subsection{Physical properties of the capacitor and capacitance}

The capacitance of a capacitor is proportional to the surface area of the
conducting plate and inversely proportional to the distance
between the plates. It also depends on the dielectric between the plates. We say that it is proportional to the permittivity of
the \textit{dielectric}. The dielectric is the non-conducting
substance that separates the plates. As mentioned before, dielectrics can be air, paper, mica, perspex
or glass.\\
 
The capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is given by:
\nequ{C=\epsilon_0 \frac{A}{d}} where $\epsilon_0$ is, in this case, the
permittivity of air, $A$ is the area of the plates and $d$ is the
distance between the plates.


\begin{wex}{Capacitance}{What is the capacitance of a capacitor in which the
dielectric is air, the area of the plates is $0,001 {\rm m^2}$ and the distance
between the plates is $0,02 {\rm m}$?}{

\end{eqnarray}

}\end{wex}

\subsection{Electric field in a capacitor}

The electric field strength between the plates of a capacitor can be calculated using the formula:\\
$E = \frac{V}{d}$ \\ 
where $E$ is the electric field in ${\rm J.C^{-1}}$, $V$ is the potential difference in volts (${\rm V}$) and $d$ is the distance between the plates in metres (${\rm m}$).\\

\subsection{A capacitor in a circuit}
When a capacitor is connected in a DC circuit, current will flow
until the capacitor is fully charged. After that, no further
current will flow. If the charged capacitor is connected to
another circuit with no source of emf in it, the capacitor will
discharge through the circuit, creating a potential difference for
a short time. This is useful, for example, in a camera flash.\\
 
Initially, the electrodes have no net charge.  A
voltage source is applied to charge a capacitor.  The voltage source creates an electric
field, causing the electrons to move. The charges move around the
circuit stopping at the left electrode.  Here they are unable to
travel across the dielectric, since electrons cannot travel
through an insulator. The charge begins to accumulate, and an
electric field forms pointing from the left electrode to the right
electrode.  This is the opposite direction of the electric field
created by the voltage source. When this electric field is equal
to the electric field created by the voltage source, the electrons
stop moving.  The capacitor is then fully charged, with a positive
charge on the left electrode and a negative charge on the right
electrode.\\
 
If the voltage is removed, the capacitor will discharge.  The
electrons begin to move because in the absence of the voltage
source, there is now a net electric field.  This field is due to
the imbalance of charge on the electrodes--the field across the
dielectric. Just as the electrons flowed to the positive electrode
when the capacitor was being charged, during discharge, the
electrons flow to negative electrode.  The charges cancel, and
there is no longer an electric field across the dielectric.

\subsection{Real-world applications: capacitors}
Capacitors are used in many different types of circuitry.  In car
speakers, capacitors are often used to aid the power supply when
the speakers require more power than the car battery can provide.
Capacitors are also used in processing electronic signals in
circuits, such as smoothing voltage spikes due to inconsistent
voltage sources. This is important for protecting sensitive electronic components in a circuit.

\chapter{Electromagnetism - Grade 11}
\label{p:em:em11}

\section{Introduction}

Electromagnetism describes between charges, currents and the electric and magnetic fields which they give rise to. An electric current creates a magnetic field and a changing magnetic field will create a flow of charge. This relationship between electricity and magnetism has resulted in the invention of many devices which are useful to humans.

\section{Magnetic field associated with a current}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item Provide evidence for the existence of a magnetic field near a current carrying wire.
%\item Use the Right Hand Rule to determine the magnetic field associated with: (a) a straight current carrying wire, (b) a current carrying loop of wire and (c) a solenoid.
%\item Note: A simple form of evidence for the existence of a magnetic field near a current carrying wire is that a compass needle placed near the wire will deflect (link to Grade 10).
%\item Note: In all situations involving magnetic fields and moving charges, only the Right hand Rule is used to find directions.  This is done to reduce confusion amongst learners who may struggle trying to remember which hand and which fingers to use if there is more than one rule.
%\item Suggestions: Explain the right hand rule only!
%\item Suggestions: show notation and field directions then have a suggestion/exercise that they try to figure out a rule (hint - use hands and fingers) to determine which way the field goes
%\item Suggestions: Try to include possible questions that help test the above content
%\end{syllabus}

If you hold a compass near a wire through which current is
flowing, the needle on the compass will be deflected.

Since compasses work by pointing along magnetic field lines, this means that there must be a magnetic field near the wire through which the current is flowing.

\begin{IFact}{The discovery of the relationship between magnetism and electricity was, like so many other scientific discoveries, stumbled upon almost by accident. The Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted was lecturing one day in 1820 on the possibility of electricity and magnetism being related to one another, and in the process demonstrated it conclusively by experiment in front of his whole class. By passing an electric current through a metal wire suspended above a magnetic compass, Oersted was able to produce a definite motion of the compass needle in response to the current. What began as a guess at the start of the class session was confirmed as fact at the end. Needless to say, Oersted had to revise his lecture notes for future classes. His discovery paved the way for a whole new branch of science - electromagnetism.}
\end{IFact}

The magnetic field produced by an electric current is always
oriented perpendicular to the direction of the current flow. When
we are drawing directions of magnetic fields and currents, we use
the symbols $\odot$ and $\otimes$.
 The symbol \nequ{\odot} represents an
arrow that is coming out of the page and the symbol \nequ{\otimes}
represents an arrow that is going into the page.
 
It is easy to remember the meanings of the symbols if you think of
an arrow with a head and a tail.

When the arrow is coming out of the page, you see the point of the
arrow ($\odot$). When the arrow is going into the page, you see
the tail of the arrow ($\otimes$).
 
The direction of the magnetic field around the current carrying
conductor is shown in Figure~\ref{p:em:em11:mfccc}.

There is a simple method of finding the relationship between the
direction of the current flowing in a conductor and the direction
of the magnetic field around the same conductor. The method is
called the \textit {Right Hand Rule}. Simply stated, the right
hand rule says that the magnetic field lines produced by a
current-carrying wire will be oriented in the same direction as the
curled fingers of a person's right hand (in the "hitchhiking"
position), with the thumb pointing in the direction of the current
flow.

\Activity{Case Study}{Magnetic field around a loop of conductor}{Consider two

If you make a loop of current carrying conductor, then the
direction of the magnetic field is obtained by applying the Right
Hand Rule to different points in the loop.

If we now add another loop with the current in the same direction, then the magnetic field around each
loop can be added together to create a stronger magnetic field. A coil of many such loops is called a \textit{solenoid}. The magnetic field pattern around a solenoid is similar to the magnetic field pattern around the bar magnet that you studied in Grade 10, which had a definite north and south pole.

\subsection{Real-world applications}
\subsubsection{Electromagnets}
An \textit{electromagnet} is a piece of wire intended to generate
a magnetic field with the passage of electric current through it.
Though all current-carrying conductors produce magnetic fields, an
electromagnet is usually constructed in such a way as to maximize
the strength of the magnetic field it produces for a special
purpose. Electromagnets are commonly used in research,
industry, medical, and consumer products. An example of a commonly used electromagnet is in security doors, e.g. on shop doors which open automatically.
 
As an electrically-controllable magnet, electromagnets form part of a wide variety of "electromechanical" devices:
machines that produce a mechanical force or motion through electrical
power. Perhaps the most obvious example of such a machine is the
\textit{electric motor} which will be described in detail in Grade
12. Other examples of the use of electromagnets are electric bells, relays, loudspeakers and scrapyard cranes.

\Activity{Experiment}{Electromagnets}{

When the north pole of a magnet is pushed into a solenoid the flux in the solenoid increases so the induced current will have an associated magnetic field pointing out of the solenoid (opposite to the magnet's field).  When the north pole is pulled out, the flux decreases, so the induced current will have an associated magnetic field pointing into the solenoid (same direction as the magnet's field) to try to oppose the change. The directions of currents and associated magnetic fields can all be found using only the Right Hand Rule.

%\end{syllabus}

While Oersted's surprising discovery of electromagnetism paved the
way for more practical applications of electricity, it was Michael
Faraday who gave us the key to the practical generation of
electricity: \textbf{electromagnetic induction}.
 
Faraday discovered that a voltage was generated across a length of
wire while moving a magnet nearby, such that the distance between
the two changed. This meant that the wire was exposed to a
magnetic field flux of changing intensity. Furthermore, the
voltage also depended on the orientation of the magnet; this is
easily understood again in terms of the magnetic flux. The flux
will be at its maximum as the magnet is aligned perpendicular to
the wire. The magnitude of the changing
flux and the voltage are linked. In fact, if the lines of flux are
parallel to the wire, there will be no induced voltage.

\Definition{Faraday's Law}{The emf,
$\epsilon$, produced around a loop of conductor is proportional to
the rate of change of the magnetic flux, $\phi$, through the area,
$A$, of the loop. This can be stated mathematically as:
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon=-N\frac{\Delta \phi}{\Delta t}
\end {equation*}
 where $\phi=B\cdot A$ and $B$ is the strength of the magnetic field.}

Faraday's Law relates induced emf to the rate of change of flux,
which is the product of the magnetic field and the cross-sectional
area the field lines pass through.

When the north pole of a magnet is pushed into a solenoid, the
flux in the solenoid increases so the induced current will have an
associated magnetic field pointing out of the solenoid (opposite
to the magnet's field).  When the north pole is pulled out, the
flux decreases, so the induced current will have an associated
magnetic field pointing into the solenoid (same direction as the
magnet's field) to try to oppose the change. The directions of
currents and associated magnetic fields can all be found using
only the Right Hand Rule. When the fingers of the right hand are
pointed in the direction of the magnetic field, the thumb points in the
direction of the current. When the thumb is pointed in the
direction of the magnetic field, the fingers point in the
direction of the current.

\Tip{An easy way to create a magnetic field of changing
intensity is to move a permanent magnet next to a wire or coil of
wire.  The magnetic field must increase or decrease in intensity
\textit{perpendicular} to the wire (so that the magnetic field lines "cut
across" the conductor), or else no voltage will be induced.}

\Tip{Finding the direction of the induced current}{The induced
current generates a magnetic field. The induced magnetic field is
in a direction that tends to cancel out the change in the magnetic field in the loop of wire. So, you can use the Right Hand Rule to find
the direction of the induced current by remembering that the
induced magnetic field is opposite in direction to the change in the magnetic
field.}

Electromagnetic induction is put into practical use in the
construction of electrical generators, which use mechanical power
to move a magnetic field past coils of wire to generate voltage.
However, this is by no means the only practical use for this
principle.
 
If we recall that the magnetic field produced by a
current-carrying wire is always perpendicular to the wire, and
that the flux intensity of this magnetic field varies with the
amount of current which passes through it, we can see that a wire is capable of
inducing a voltage \textit{along its own length} if the current is changing. This effect is called
\textit{self-induction}. Self-induction is when a changing magnetic field is produced by
changes in current through a wire, inducing a voltage along the
length of that same wire.
  
If the magnetic flux is enhanced
by bending the wire into the shape of a coil, and/or wrapping that
coil around a material of high permeability, this effect of
self-induced voltage will be more intense. A device constructed to
take advantage of this effect is called an \textit{inductor}, and
will be discussed in greater detail in the next chapter.

\Extension{Lenz's Law}{The induced current will create a magnetic
field that opposes the change in the magnetic flux.}

\begin{wex}
{Faraday's Law} {Consider a flat square coil with 5 turns. The
coil is 0,50~m on each side, and has a magnetic field of 0,5~T
passing through it. The plane of the coil is perpendicular to the
magnetic field: the field points out of the page. Use Faraday's
Law to calculate the induced emf, if the magnetic field is

direction of the induced current.

This changing magnetic field induces an emf, which creates a current in the secondary coil.Transformers are very important in the supply of electricity nationally. In order to reduce energy losses due to heating, electrical energy is transported from power stations along power lines at high voltage and low current.  Transformers are used to step the voltage up from the power station to the power lines, and step it down from the power lines to buildings where it is needed.

%\end{syllabus}

One of the real-world applications of Faraday's Law is in a
\textit{transformer}.
 
Eskom generates electricity at around 22~000~V. When you plug in a
toaster, the mains voltage is 220~V. A transformer is used to
\textit{step-down} the high voltage to the lower voltage that is
used as mains voltage.

\Definition{Transformer}{A transformer is an electrical device
that uses the principle of induction between the primary coil and
the secondary coil to either step-up or step-down the voltage.}

The essential features of a transformer are two coils of wire,
called the primary coil and the secondary coil, which are wound around
different sections of the same iron core.

%\uput[u](0,2){Main features of a transformer}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

When an alternating voltage is applied to the primary coil it
creates an alternating current in that coil, which induces an
alternating magnetic field in the iron core.  The changing
magnetic flux through the secondary coil induces an emf, which creates a current in this secondary coil.

The circuit symbol for a transformer is:

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(2.5,2.5)
%\psgrid
\psset{unit=0.5} \pnode(0,5){A} \pnode(0,0){B} \pnode(5,5){C}
\pnode(5,0){D} \transformer(A)(B)(C)(D){$\mathcal T$}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

By choosing the number of coils in the secondary solenoid relative to the number of coils in the primary solenoid, we can choose how much bigger or smaller the induced secondary current is by comparison to the current in the primary solenoid (so by how much the current is stepped up or down.)

This ability to transform
voltage and current levels according to a simple ratio, determined
by the ratio of input and output coil turns is a very useful property of transformers and accounts for the name. We can derive a
mathematical relationship by using Faraday's law.
 
Assume that an alternating voltage ${V_p}$ is applied to the
primary coil (which has $N_p$ turns) of a transformer. The current
that results from this voltage generates a changing magnetic flux $\phi_p$.
We can then describe the emf in the primary coil by: \nequ{V_p =
N_p\frac{\Delta \phi_p}{\Delta t}} Similarly, for the secondary
coil, \nequ{V_s = N_s\frac{\Delta \phi_s}{\Delta t}}
 
If we assume that the primary and secondary windings are perfectly
coupled, then: \nequ{\phi_p = \phi_s} which means that:
\begin {equation*}
\frac{V_p}{V_s}=\frac{N_p}{N_s}
\end {equation*}

\begin{wex}{Transformer specifications}{Calculate the voltage on the secondary coil if the voltage on the primary coil is 120~V and the ratio of primary windings to secondary windings is 10:1.}{

\item $\frac{N_p}{N_s}=\frac{10}{1}$

\westep{Rearrange equation to solve for $V_s$}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{V_p}{V_s}&=&\frac{N_p}{N_s}\\

\therefore V_s&=&\frac{1}{\frac{N_p}{N_s}}V_p
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Substitute values and solve for $V_s$}
\begin{eqnarray*}
V_s&=&\frac{1}{\frac{N_p}{N_s}}V_p\\
&=&\frac{1}{\frac{10}{1}}120\\
&=&12\;\rm{V}
\end{eqnarray*}

}
\end{wex}


A transformer designed to output more voltage than it takes in
across the input coil is called a \textit{step-up} transformer. A
step-up transformer has more windings on the secondary coil than
on the primary coil. This means that: \nequ{N_s>N_p}
 
Similarly, a transformer designed to output less than it takes in
across the input coil is called a \textit{step-down} transformer.
A step-down transformer has more windings on the primary coil than
on the primary coil. This means that: \nequ{N_p>N_s}
 
We use a step-up transformer to increase the voltage from the primary coil to the secondary coil. It is used at power stations to increase the voltage for the transmission lines.
A step-down transformer decreases the voltage from the primary coil to the secondary coil. It is particularly used to decrease the voltage from the transmission lines to a voltage which can be used in factories and in homes.
 
Transformer technology has made long-range electric power
distribution practical. Without the ability to efficiently step
voltage up and down, it would be cost-prohibitive to construct
power systems for anything but close-range (within a few kilometres) use.
 
As useful as transformers are, they only work with AC,
not DC. This is because the phenomenon of mutual inductance relies on
\textit{changing} magnetic fields, and direct current (DC) can
only produce steady magnetic fields, transformers simply will not
work with direct current.
 
Of course, direct current may be
interrupted (pulsed) through the primary winding of a transformer
to create a changing magnetic field (as is done in automotive
ignition systems to produce high-voltage spark plug power from a
low-voltage DC battery), but pulsed DC is not that different from
AC. Perhaps more than any other reason, this is why AC finds such
widespread application in power systems.

electrical energy is transported from power stations along power

When a charged particle moves through a magnetic field it
experiences a force. For a particle that is moving at right angles
to the magnetic field, the force is given by:
 \begin {equation*}
F = qvB
\end {equation*}
 where $q$ is the charge on the particle, $v$
is the velocity of the particle and $B$ is the magnetic field
through which the particle is moving. Thsi force is called the Lorentz force.

\section{Introduction}

The study of electrical circuits is essential to understand the technology that uses electricity in the real-world. This includes electricity being used for the operation of electronic devices like computers.




\section{Ohm's Law}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item Determine the relationship between current, voltage and resistance at constant temperature using a simple circuit
%\item State the difference between Ohmic and non-Ohmic conductors, and give an example of each
%\item Solve problems using the mathematical expression of Ohm's Law, R=V/I
%\item Note: Link to Grade 10. A light bulb is a common example of a non-Ohmic conductor. Nichrome wire is an Ohmic conductor. Try to let learners do experiments in which they measure the current through, and voltage across an Ohmic and a non-Ohmic conductor. If they use nichrome wire, ensure that they only close the circuit for a very short time or else the nichrome will heat up and its resistance will change.

An important relationship between the current, voltage and resistance in a circuit was discovered by Georg Simon Ohm and is called \textbf{Ohm's Law}.

\Definition{Ohm's Law}{The amount of electric current through a metal conductor, at a constant temperature, in a circuit is proportional to the voltage across the conductor. Mathematically, Ohm's Law is written:
\begin{equation*}
V=R\cdot I.
\end{equation*}}

Ohm's Law tells us that if a conductor is at a constant temperature, the current flowing through the conductor is proportional to the voltage across it. This means that if we plot voltage on the $x$-axis of a graph and current on the $y$-axis of the graph, we will get a straight-line. The gradient of the straight-line graph is related to the resistance of the conductor.

\subsection{Ohmic and non-ohmic conductors}

As you have seen, there is a mention of \textit{constant temperature} when we talk about Ohm's Law. This is because the resistance of some conductors changes as their temperature changes. These types of conductors are called \textit{non-ohmic} conductors, because they do not obey Ohm's Law. As can be expected, the conductors that obey Ohm's Law are called \textit{ohmic} conductors. A light bulb is a common example of a non-ohmic conductor. Nichrome wire is an ohmic conductor.

In a light bulb, the resistance of the filament wire will increase dramatically as it warms from room temperature to operating temperature. If we increase the supply voltage in a real lamp circuit, the resulting increase in current causes the filament to increase in temperature, which increases its resistance. This effectively limits the increase in current. In this case, voltage and current do not obey Ohm's Law.

The phenomenon of resistance changing with variations in temperature is one shared by almost all metals, of which most wires are made. For most applications, these changes in resistance are small enough to be ignored. In the application of metal lamp filaments, which increase a lot in temperature (up to about 1000$^\circ$C, and starting from room temperature) the change is quite large.

In general non-ohmic conductors have plots of voltage against current that are curved, indicating that the resistance is not constant over all values of voltage and current.

\end{center}

\Activity{Experiment}{Ohmic and non-ohmic conductors}{Repeat the experiment as decribed in the previous section. In this case use a light bulb as a resistor. Compare your results to the ohmic resistor.}

\subsection{Using Ohm's Law}

We are now ready to see how Ohm's Law is used to analyse circuits.

Consider the circuit with an ohmic resistor, $R$. If the resistor has a resistance of 5~\ohm\ and voltage across the resistor is 5 V, then we can use Ohm's law to calculate the current flowing through the resistor.

\psline(D)(A)
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

Ohm's law is:
\nequ{V=R \cdot I}
which can be rearranged to:
\nequ{I=\frac{V}{R}}

The current flowing through the resistor is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
I&=&\frac{V}{R}\\
&=&\frac{5\;\mathrm{V}}{5\;\eohm}\\
&=&1\;\mathrm{A}
\end{eqnarray*}

\section{Resistance}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item Calculate the equivalent resistance of series and parallel arrangements of resistors.
%\item Solve problems involving current, voltage and resistance for circuits containing arrangements of resistors in series and in parallel.
%\item State that a real battery has internal resistance
%\item Explain why there is a difference between the emf and terminal voltage of a battery if the load (external resistance in the circuit) is comparable in size to the battery's internal resistance
%\item Solve circuit problems in which the internal resistance of the battery must be considered.
%\item Note: Some books use the term "lost volts" to refer to the difference between the emf and the terminal voltage. This is misleading. The voltage is not "lost", it is across the internal resistance of the battery. The internal resistance of the battery can be treated just like another resistor in series in the circuit. The sum of the voltages across the external circuit plus the voltage across the internal resistance is equal to the emf:e = V(load) + V(internal resistance)
%\end{syllabus}

In Grade 10, you learnt about resistors and were introduced to circuits where resistors were connected in series and circuits where resistors were connected in parallel. In a series circuit there is one path for the current to flow through. In a parallel circuit there are multiple paths for the current to flow through.

\subsection{Equivalent resistance}
When there is more than one resistor in a circuit, we are usually able to calculate the total combined resitance of all the resistors. The resistance of the single resistor is known as \textit{equivalent resistance}.

\subsubsection{Equivalent Series Resistance}
Consider a circuit consisting of three resistors and a
single cell connected in series. 

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(0,0)(5,5)
%\psgrid
\pnode(1,4){A}
\pnode(4,4){B}

\uput[ur](B){B}
\uput[dr](C){C}
\uput[dl](D){D}
\psdots(A)(B)(C)(D)
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

The first principle to understand about series circuits is that the amount of current is the same through any component in the circuit. This is because there is only one path for electrons to flow in a series circuit. From the way that the battery is connected, we can tell which direction the current will flow. We know that current flows from positive to negative, by convention. Current in this circuit will flow in a clockwise direction, from point A to B to C to D and back to A.

So, how do we use this knowledge to calculate the total resistance in the circuit?

We know that in a series circuit the current has to be the same in all components. So we can write:

\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:seriesR:I}
I = I_1 =I_2=I_3
\end{equation*}

We also know that total voltage of the circuit has to be equal to the sum of the voltages over all three resistors. So we can write:

\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:seriesR:V}
V=V_1+V_2+V_3
\end{equation*}

Finally, we know that Ohm's Law has to apply for each resistor individually, which gives us:

\begin{eqnarray*}
V_1 & = & I_1\cdot R_1 \\
V_2 & = & I_2\cdot R_2 \\
V_3 & = & I_3\cdot R_3
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore:

\begin{equation*}
V=I_1\cdot R_1+I_2\cdot R_2+I_3\cdot R_3
\end{equation*}
However, because
\begin{equation*}
I = I_1 =I_2=I_3
\end{equation*} , we can further simplify this to:

\begin{eqnarray*}
V&=&I \cdot R_1+ I \cdot R_2+I  \cdot R_3\\
&=&I (R_1+R_2+R_3)
\end{eqnarray*}
Further, we can write an Ohm's Law relation for the entire circuit:
\nequ{V=I\cdot R}
Therefore:
\begin{eqnarray*}
V&=&I (R_1+R_2+R_3)\\
I\cdot R&=&I (R_1+R_2+R_3)\\
\therefore\quad R&=&R_1+R_2+R_3
\end{eqnarray*}

\Definition{Equivalent resistance in a series circuit, $R_s$}
{For $n$ resistors in series the equivalent resistance is:
\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:seriesR:R}
R_s=R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3}+\cdots+R_n
\end{equation*}}
Let us apply this to the following circuit.

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(0,0)(5,5)
%\psgrid
\pnode(1,4){A}
\pnode(4,4){B}
\pnode(4,1){C}

\resistor[dipolestyle=rectangle](A)(B){R$_{1}$=3~\ohm}
\resistor[labeloffset=1.2cm,dipolestyle=rectangle](B)(C){R$_{2}$=10~\ohm}
\resistor[dipolestyle=rectangle](C)(D){R$_{3}$=5~\ohm}
\battery[labeloffset=1cm](A)(D){9~V}

\uput[ur](B){B}
\uput[dr](C){C}
\uput[dl](D){D}
\psdots(A)(B)(C)(D)
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

The resistors are in series, therefore:
\begin{eqnarray*}
R_s&=&R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3}\\
&=&3\eohm+10\eohm+5\eohm\\
&=&18\eohm
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{wex}{Equivalent series resistance I}{Two 10~k\ohm\ resistors are connected in series. Calculate the equivalent resistance.}{

\westep{Determine how to approach the problem}
Since the resistors are in series we can use:
\nequ{R_s=R_{1}+R_{2}}

\westep{Solve the problem}
\begin{eqnarray*}

&=&10\,\rm{k}\eohm+10\,\rm{k}\eohm\\

\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Write the final answer}
The equivalent resistance of two 10~k\ohm\ resistors connected in series is 20~k\ohm.}
\end{wex}

\begin{wex}{Equivalent series resistance II}{Two resistors are connected in series. The equivalent resistance is 100~\ohm. If one resistor is 10~\ohm, calculate the value of the second resistor.}{

\westep{Determine how to approach the problem}
Since the resistors are in series we can use:
\nequ{R_s=R_{1}+R_{2}}
We are given the value of $R_s$ and $R_1$.

\westep{Solve the problem}
\begin{eqnarray*}
R_s&=&R_{1}+R_{2}\\
\therefore\quad R_2&=&R_s-R_1\\
&=&100\eohm-10\eohm\\
&=&90\eohm
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Write the final answer}
The second resistor has a resistance of 90~\ohm.}
\end{wex}

Consider a circuit consisting of a single cell and three resistors that are connected in parallel.

\end{center}

The first principle to understand about parallel circuits is that the
voltage is equal across all components in the circuit. This is because there are only two sets of electrically common points in a parallel circuit, and voltage measured between sets of common points must always be the same at any given time. So, for the circuit shown, the following is true: 

\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:parallelR:V}
V=V_1=V_2=V_3
\end{equation*}

The second principle for a parallel circuit is that all the currents through each resistor must add up to the total current in the circuit. 

\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:parallelR:I}
I=I_1+I_2+I_3
\end{equation*}

Also, from applying Ohm's Law to the entire circuit, we can write:
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{I}{R_p}
\end{equation*}
where $R_p$ is the equivalent resistance in this parallel arrangement.

We are now ready to apply Ohm's Law to each resistor, to get:
\begin{eqnarray*}
V_1&=&R_1\cdot I_1\\
V_2&=&R_2\cdot I_2\\
V_3&=&R_3\cdot I_3
\end{eqnarray*}
This can be also written as:
\begin{eqnarray*}
I_1&=&\frac{V_1}{R_1}\\
I_2&=&\frac{V_2}{R_2}\\
I_3&=&\frac{V_3}{R_3}
\end{eqnarray*}

Now we have:
\begin{eqnarray*}
I&=&I_1+I_2+I_3\\
\frac{V}{R_p}&=&\frac{V_1}{R_1}+\frac{V_2}{R_2}+\frac{V_3}{R_3}\\
&=&\frac{V}{R_1}+\frac{V}{R_2}+\frac{V}{R_3}\\

\subsection{Batteries and internal resistance}

Real batteries are made from materials which have resistance. This means that real batteries are not just sources of potential difference (voltage), but they also possess internal resistance. If the total voltage source is referred to as the emf, ${\cal E}$, then a real battery can be represented as an emf  connected in series with a resistor $r$. The internal resistance of the battery is represented by the symbol $r$. 

\begin{center}

\uput[d](2.5,0.4){$V$}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

\Definition{Load}{The external resistance in the circuit is referred to as the load.}

Suppose that the battery with emf $\mathcal{E}$ and internal resistance $r$ supplies a current $I$ through an external load resistor $R$. Then the voltage drop across the load resistor is that supplied by the battery:
\nequ{V=I\cdot R}
Similarly, from Ohm's Law, the voltage drop across the internal resistance is: 
\nequ{V_r=I\cdot r}

The voltage $V$ of the battery is related to its emf ${\cal E}$ and internal resistance $r$ by:
\begin{eqnarray*}
{\cal E} &=& V + I r ;or\\
V&=& {\cal E} - I r
\end{eqnarray*}

The emf of a battery is essentially constant because it only depends on the chemical reaction (that converts chemical energy into electrical energy) going on inside the battery. Therefore, we can see that the voltage across the terminals of the battery is dependent on the current drawn by the load. The higher the current, the lower the voltage across the terminals, because the emf is constant. By the same reasoning, the voltage only equals the emf when the current is very small.

The maximum current that can be drawn from a battery is limited by a critical value $I_c$. At a current of $I_c$, $V$=0~V. Then, the equation becomes:
\begin{eqnarray*}
0 &=& {\cal E} - I_c r\\
I_c r &=& {\cal E}\\
I_c&=&\frac{{\cal E}}{r}
\end{eqnarray*}
The maximum current that can be drawn from a battery is less than $\frac{{\cal E}}{r}$.


\begin{wex}{Internal resistance}{What is the internal resistance of a battery if its emf is 12~V and the voltage drop across its terminals is 10~V when a current of 4~A flows in the circuit when it is connected across a load?}{
\westep{Determine how to approach the problem}
It is an internal resistance problem. So we use the equation:
\begin{eqnarray*}
{\cal E} &=& V + I r
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Solve the problem}
\begin{eqnarray*}
{\cal E} &=& V + I r\\
12&=&10 + 4(r)\\ 
&=&0.5
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Write the final answer}
The internal resistance of the resistor is 0.5~\ohm.}

It is relatively easy to work out these kind of circuits because you use everything you have already learnt about series and parallel circuits. The only difference is that you do it in stages. In Figure~\ref{fig:serpar}, the circuit consists of 2 parallel portions that are then in series with 1 resistor. So, in order to work out the equivalent resistance, you start by calculating the total resistance of the parallel portions and then add up all the resistances in series. If all the resistors in Figure~\ref{fig:serpar} had resistances of 10~\ohm, we can calculate the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit.

We start by calculating the total resistance of \textit{Parallel Circuit 1}.

\section{Wheatstone bridge}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item Given a circuit diagram, explain how the Wheatstone bridge can be used for determining resistances very accurately
%\item Derive an expression for the unknown resistance in terms of the known resistances when the bridge circuit is balanced
%\item Note: The Wheatstone Bridge enables very accurate measurements of resistance to be made by inserting an unknown resistor into a bridge circuit containing three resistors that are already accurately known, one of which is variable. The resistance of the variable resistor is changed until a galvanometer reads zero, indicating that the bridge circuit is balanced.
%\end{syllabus}

Another method of finding an unknown resistance is to use a \textit{Wheatstone bridge}. A Wheatstone bridge is a measuring instrument that is used to measure an unknown electrical resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, one leg of which includes the unknown component. Its operation is similar to the original potentiometer except that in potentiometer circuits the meter used is a sensitive galvanometer.

\begin{IFact}{The Wheatstone bridge was invented by Samuel Hunter Christie in 1833 and improved and popularized by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1843.}

In the circuit of the Wheatstone bridge, $R_x$ is the unknown resistance. $R_1$, $R_2$ and $R_3$ are resistors of known resistance and the resistance of $R_2$ is adjustable. If the ratio of $R_2$:$R_1$ is equal to the ratio of $R_x$:$R_3$, then the voltage between the two midpoints will be zero and no current will flow between the midpoints. In order to determine the unknown resistance, $R_2$ is varied until this condition is reached. That is when the voltmeter reads 0~V.

\Extension{Power in electric circuits}{
In addition to voltage and current, there is another measure of free electron activity in a circuit: \textit{power}. Power is a measure of how rapidly a standard amount of \textit{work} is done. In electric circuits, power is a function of both voltage and current:
\Definition{Electrical Power}{Electrical power is calculated as:
\begin{equation*}
P=I \cdot V
\end{equation*}}

Power ($P$) is exactly equal to current ($I$) multiplied by voltage
($V$) and there is no extra constant of proportionality. The unit of
measurement for power is the \textit{Watt} (abbreviated W).


\begin{IFact}{It was James Prescott Joule, not Georg Simon Ohm, who first discovered the mathematical relationship between power dissipation and current through a resistance. This discovery, published in 1841, followed the form of the equation:
\nequ{P = I^{2}R}
and is properly known as Joule's Law. However, these power equations are so commonly associated with the Ohm's Law equations relating voltage, current, and resistance that they are frequently credited to Ohm.}
\end{IFact}

\Activity{Investigation}{Equivalence}{Use Ohm's Law to show that:
\nequ{P=VI}
is identical to
\nequ{P = I^{2}R} 
and 
\nequ{P = \frac{V^{2}}{R}}
}}

\section{Summary}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ohm's Law states that the amount of current through a conductor, at constant temperature, is proportional to the voltage across the resistor. Mathematically we write $V=I \cdot R$
\item Conductors that obey Ohm's Law are called ohmic conductors; those that do not are called non-ohmic conductors.
\item We use Ohm's Law to calculate the resistance of a resistor. $R=\frac{V}{I}$
\item The equivalent resistance of resistors in series ($R_s$) can be calculated as follows: $R_s=R_1+R_2+R_3+ ...+R_n$
\item The equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel ($R_p$) can be calculated as follows: $\frac{1}{R_p}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{1}{R_3}+ ... +\frac{1}{R_n}$
\item Real batteries have an internal resistance.
\item Wheatstone bridges can be used to accurately determine the resistance of an unknown resistor.

\chapter{Electronic Properties of Matter - Grade 11}
\label{p:mm:ep11}

\section{Introduction}

We can study many different features of solids. Just a few of the things we could study are how hard or soft they are, what their magnetic properties are or how well they conduct heat. The thing that we are interested in, in this chapter are their electronic properties. Simply, how well do they conduct electricity and how do they do it.

We are only going to discuss materials that form a 3-dimensional lattice. This means that the atoms that make up the material have a regular pattern (carbon, silicon, etc.). We won't discuss materials where the atoms are jumbled together in a irregular way (plastic, glass, rubber etc.).

\section{Conduction}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to explain how energy levels of electrons in an atom combine with those of other atoms in the formation of crystals.
%\item The learner must be able to explain how the resulting energy levels are more closely spaced than those in the individual atoms, forming energy bands; and thus
%\item The learner must be able to explain the existence of energy bands in metal crystals as the result of superposition of energy levels.
%\item The learner must be able to explain and contrast the conductivity of conductors, semi-conductors and insulators using energy band theory.
%\end{syllabus}

We know that there are materials that do conduct electricity, called conductors, like the copper wires in the circuits you build. There are also materials that do not conduct electricity, called insulators, like the plastic covering on the copper wires.

Conductors come in two major categories: metals (e.g. copper) and semi-conductors (e.g. silicon). Metals conduct very well and semi-conductors don't. One very interesting difference is that metals conduct less as they become hotter but semi-conductors conduct more.

What is different about these substances that makes them conduct differently? That is what we are about to find out.

We have learnt that electrons in an atom have discrete energy levels. When an electron is given the right amount of energy, it can jump to a higher energy level, while if it loses the right amount of energy it can drop to a lower energy level. The lowest energy level is known as the ground state.

\uput[r](0,4){\parbox[r]{4.5cm}{energy levels of the electrons in a single atom}}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

When two atoms are far apart from each other they don't influence each other. Look at the picture below. There are two atoms depicted by the black dots. When they are far apart their electron clouds (the gray clouds) are distinct. The dotted line depicts the distance of the outermost electron energy level that is occupied.
\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-5,-2)(5,2)
\pscircle[linestyle=dotted,linecolor=lightgray,fillstyle=ccslope,slopebegin=black,slopeend=white](-3,0){2}
\pscircle[linestyle=dotted,linecolor=lightgray,fillstyle=ccslope,slopebegin=black,slopeend=white](3,0){2}
\psdot[dotscale=2](3,0)
\psdot[dotscale=2](-3,0)
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}
In  some lattice structures the atoms would be closer together. If they are close enough their electron clouds, and therefore electron energy levels start to overlap. Look at the picture below. In this picture the two atoms are closer together. The electron clouds now overlap. The overlapping area is coloured in solid gray to make it easier to see.

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-5,-2)(5,2)
\pscircle[linestyle=dotted,linecolor=lightgray,fillstyle=ccslope,slopebegin=black,slopeend=white](-1,0){2}
\pscircle[linestyle=dotted,linecolor=lightgray,fillstyle=ccslope,slopebegin=black,slopeend=white](1,0){2}
   \pscustom[linestyle=dotted,linecolor=gray,fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=lightgray]{%
      \psarc(-1,0){2}{300}{60}  % B
      \psarc(1,0){2}{120}{240}}  % B
\psdot[dotscale=2](1,0)
\psdot[dotscale=2](-1,0)
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

When this happens we might find two electrons with the same energy and spin in the same space. We know that this is not allowed from the Pauli exclusion principle. Something must change to allow the overlapping to happen. The change is that the energies of the energy levels change a tiny bit so that the electrons are not in exactly the same spin and energy state at the same time. 

So if we have 2 atoms then in the overlapping area we will have twice the number of electrons and energy levels but the energy levels from the different atoms will be very very close in energy. If we had 3 atoms then there would be 3 energy levels very close in energy and so on. In a solid there may be very many energy levels that are very close in energy. These groups of energy levels are called bands. The spacing between these bands determines whether the solid is a conductor or an insulator.

\end{center}

In a gas, the atoms are spaced far apart and they do not influence each other. However, the atoms in a solid greatly influence each other. The forces that bind these atoms together in a solid affect how the electrons of the atoms behave, by causing the individual energy levels of an atom to break up and form energy bands. The resulting energy levels are more closely spaced than those in the individual atoms. The energy bands still contain discrete energy levels, but there are now many more energy levels than in the single atom. 

In crystalline solids, atoms interact with their neighbors, and the energy levels of the electrons in isolated atoms turn into bands. Whether a material conducts or not is determined by its band structure.

Electrons follow the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning that two electrons cannot occupy the same state. Thus electrons in a solid fill up the energy bands up to a certain level (this is called the Fermi energy). Bands which are completely full of electrons cannot conduct electricity, because there is no state of nearby energy to which the electrons can jump. Materials in which all bands are full are insulators. 

\subsection{Metals}

Metals are good conductors because they have unfilled spaces in the valence energy band. In the absence of an electric field, there are electrons traveling in all directions. When an electric field is applied the mobile electrons flow. Electrons in this band can be accelerated by the electric field because there are plenty of nearby unfilled spaces in the band.

\subsection{Insulator}

The energy diagram for the insulator shows the insulator with a very wide energy gap. The wider this gap, the greater the amount of energy required to move the electron from the valence band to the conduction band. Therefore, an insulator requires a large amount of energy to obtain a small amount of current. The insulator ``insulates" because of the wide forbidden band or energy gap.

\subsubsection{Breakdown}

A solid with filled bands is an insulator. If we raise the temperature the electrons gain thermal energy. If there is enough energy added then electrons can be thermally excited from the valence band to the conduction band. The fraction of electrons excited in this way depends on:
\begin{itemize}
\item the temperature and
\item the band gap, the energy difference between the two bands. 
\end{itemize}
Exciting these electrons into the conduction band leaves behind positively charged holes in the valence band, which can also conduct electricity.

\subsection{Semi-conductors}

A semi-conductor is very similar to an insulator. The main difference between semiconductors and insulators is the size of the band gap between the conduction and valence bands. The band gap in insulators is larger than the band gap in semiconductors. 

In semi-conductors at room temperature, just as in insulators, very few electrons gain enough thermal energy to leap the band gap, which is necessary for conduction. For this reason, pure semi-conductors and insulators, in the absence of applied fields, have roughly similar electrical properties. The smaller band gaps of semi-conductors, however, allow for many other means besides temperature to control their electrical properties. The most important one being that for a certain amount of applied voltage, more current will flow in the semiconductor than in the insulator.

\section{Intrinsic Properties and Doping}

%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to explain the process of doping.
%\item The learner must be able to explain how doping improves the conductivity of semi-conductors.
%\end{syllabus}

We have seen that the size of the energy gap between the valence band and the conduction band determines whether a solid is a conductor or an insulator. However, we have seen that there is a material known as a semi-conductor. A semi-conductor is a solid whose band gap is smaller than that of an insulator and whose electrical properties can be modified by a process known as \textit{doping}. 

\Definition{Doping}{Doping is the deliberate addition of impurities to a pure semiconductor material to change its electrical properties.}

Semiconductors are often the Group IV elements in the periodic table. The most common semiconductor elements are silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge). The most important property of Group IV elements is that they have 4 valence electrons. 

\Extension{Band Gaps of Si and Ge}{Si has a band gap of $1.744\times10^{-19}$~J while Ge has a band gap of $1.152\times10^{-19}$~J.}

So, if we look at the arrangement of for example Si atoms in a crystal, they would look like that shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SiCrystal}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{pspicture}
\caption{Arrangement of atoms in a Si crystal.}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

The main aim of doping is to make sure there are either too many (surplus) or too few electrons (deficiency). Depending on what situation you want to create you use different elements for the doping.

\subsection{Surplus}

A surplus of electrons is created by adding an element that has more valence electrons than Si to the Si crystal. This is known as \textit{n-type} doping and elements used for n-type doping usually come from Group V in the periodic table. Elements from Group V have 5 valence electrons, one more than the Group IV elements. 

A common n-type dopant (substance used for doping) is arsenic (As). The combination of a semiconductor and an n-type dopant is known as an n-type semiconductor. A Si crystal doped with As is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SiAs}. When As is added to a Si crystal, 4 of the 5 valence electrons in As bond with the 4 Si valence electrons. The fifth As valence electron is free to move around. 

It takes only a few As atoms to create enough free electrons to allow an electric current to flow through the silicon. Since n-type dopants `donate' their free atoms to the semiconductor, they are known as \textit{donor atoms}.

\label{fig:SiAs}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Deficiency}

A deficiency of electrons is created by adding an element that has less valence electrons than Si to the Si crystal. This is known as \textit{p-type} doping and elements used for p-type doping usually come from Group III in the periodic table. Elements from Group III have 3 valence electrons, one less than the semiconductor elements that come from Group IV. A common p-type dopant is boron (B). The combination of a semiconductor and a p-type dopant is known as an p-type semiconductor. A Si crystal doped with B is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SiB}. When B is mixed into the silicon crystal, there is a Si valence electron that is left unbonded. 

The lack of an electron is known as a \textit{hole} and has the effect of a positive charge. Holes can conduct current. A hole happily accepts an electron from a neighbor, moving the hole over a space. Since p-type dopants `accept' electrons, they are known as \textit{acceptor atoms}.

\end{figure}

Donor (n-type) impurities have extra valence electrons with energies very close to the conduction band which can be easily thermally excited to the conduction band. Acceptor (p-type) impurities capture electrons from the valence band, allowing the easy formation of holes.

The energy level of the donor atom is close to the conduction band and it is relatively easy for electrons to enter the conduction band. The energy level of the acceptor atom is close to the valence band and it is relatively easy for electrons to leave the valence band and enter the vacancies.

%\end{syllabus}

\subsection{Differences between p- and n-type semi-conductors}
We have seen that the addition of specific elements to semiconductor materials turns them into p-type semiconductors or n-type semiconductors. The differences between n- and p-type semiconductors are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:pn}.

%\begin{table}[htbp]
%\begin{center}

%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{center}
%\end{table}

\subsection{The p-n Junction}
When p-type and n-type semiconductors are placed in contact with each other, a p-n junction is formed. Near the junction, electrons and holes combine to create a depletion region. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(1,1)(6,3.6)

\bput{:U}{}
\end{pspicture}
\caption{The p-n junction forms between p- and n-type semiconductors. The free electrons from the n-type material combine with the holes in the p-type material near the junction. There is a small potential difference across the
junction. The area near the junction is called the depletion region because there are few holes and few free electrons in this region.}
\label{fig:pnjunction}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Electric current flows more easily across a p-n junction in one direction than in the other. If the positive pole of a battery is connected to the p-side of the junction, and the negative pole to the n-side, charge flows across the junction. If the battery is connected in the opposite direction, very little charge can flow.

This might not sound very useful at first but the p-n junction forms the basis for computer chips, solar cells, and other electronic devices.

\subsection{Unbiased}

In a p-n junction, without an external applied voltage (no bias), an equilibrium condition is reached in which a potential difference is formed across the junction.

P-type is where you have more "holes"; n-type is where you have more electrons in the material. Initially, when you put them together to form a junction, holes near the junction tends to "move" across to the n-region, while the electrons in the n-region drift across to the p-region to "fill" some holes. This current will quickly stop as the potential barrier is built up by the migrated charges. So in steady state no current flows.

Then now when you put a potential different across the terminals you have two cases: forward biased and reverse biased.

\subsection{Forward biased}

Forward-bias occurs when the p-type semiconductor material is connected to the positive terminal of a battery and the n-type semiconductor material is connected to the negative terminal.

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(0,-2)(7,3)
\psframe(2,1)(3.1,2.5)
\uput[r](2.3,1.6){P}
\psframe(3.1,1)(4.2,2.5)
\uput[r](3.5,1.6){N}
\psline(2,1.25)(1,1.25)(1,-1)(3.0,-1)
\psline(4.2,1.25)(5.2,1.25)(5.2,-1)(3.2,-1)
\psline[linewidth=2pt](3,-1.5)(3,-0.5)
\psline[linewidth=2pt](3.2,-1.2)(3.2,-0.8)
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

The electric field from the external potential different can easily overcome the small internal field (in the so-called depletion region, created by the initial drifting of charges): usually anything bigger than 0.6V would be enough. The external field then attracts more e- to flow from n-region to p-region and more holes from p-region to n-region and you have a forward biased situation. the diode is forward biased and so current will flow.


\subsection{Reverse biased}


\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(0,-2)(7,3)
\psframe(2,1)(3.1,2.5)
\uput[r](2.3,1.6){N}
\psframe(3.1,1)(4.2,2.5)
\uput[r](3.5,1.6){P}
\psline(2,1.25)(1,1.25)(1,-1)(3.0,-1)
\psline(4.2,1.25)(5.2,1.25)(5.2,-1)(3.2,-1)
\psline[linewidth=2pt](3,-1.5)(3,-0.5)
\psline[linewidth=2pt](3.2,-1.2)(3.2,-0.8)
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

In this case the external field pushes e- back to the n-region while more holes into the p-region, as a result you get no current flow. Only the small number of thermally released minority carriers (holes in the n-type region and e- in the p-type region) will be able to cross the junction and form a very small current, but for all practical purposes, this can be ignored.

Of course if the reverse biased potential is large enough you get what is called avalanche break down and current flow in the opposite direction. In many cases, except for Zener diodes, you most likely will destroy the diode.


\subsection{Real-World Applications of Semiconductors}

Semiconductors form the basis of modern electronics. Every electrical appliance usually has some semiconductor-based technology inside it. The fundamental uses of semiconductors are in microchips (also known as integrated circuits) and microprocessors.

Integrated circuits are miniaturised circuits. The use of integrated circuits makes it possible for electronic devices (like a cellular telephone or a hi-fi) to get smaller. 

Microprocessors are a special type of integrated circuit.
