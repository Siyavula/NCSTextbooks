\section{Introduction}

Before we begin this section, it might be useful to think about some different types of reactions and how quickly or slowly they occur.

\Exercise{Thinking about reaction rates\\}{

Think about each of the following reactions:

\begin{itemize}
\item{rusting of metals}
\item{photosynthesis}
\item{weathering of rocks (e.g. limestone rocks being weathered by water)}
\item{combustion}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{For each of the reactions above, write a chemical equation for the reaction that takes place.}
\item{How fast is each of these reactions? Rank them in order from the fastest to the slowest.}
\item{How did you decide which reaction was the fastest and which was the slowest?}
\item{Try to think of some other examples of chemical reactions. How fast or slow is each of these reactions, compared with those listed earlier?}
\end{enumerate}

\insertpracticeinfo{1}
}

In a chemical reaction, the substances that are undergoing the reaction are called the \textbf{reactants}, while the substances that form as a result of the reaction are called the \textbf{products}. The \textbf{reaction rate} describes how quickly or slowly the reaction takes place. So how do we know whether a reaction is slow or fast? One way of knowing is to look either at how quickly the \textit{reactants are used up} during the reaction or at how quickly the \textit{product forms}. For example, iron and sulfur react according to the following equation:

\begin{center}
\rm${Fe + S \rightarrow FeS}$
\end{center}

In this reaction, we can observe the speed of the reaction by measuring how long it takes before there is no iron or sulfur left in the reaction vessel. In other words, the reactants have been used up. Alternatively, one could see how quickly the iron sulfide product forms. Since iron sulfide looks very different from either of its reactants, this is easy to do. \\

In another example:

\begin{eqnarray*}
2Mg(s) + O_{2} \rightarrow 2Mg O(s)
\end{eqnarray*}

In this case, the reaction rate depends on the speed at which the reactants (solid
magnesium and oxygen gas) are used up, or the speed at which the product (magnesium oxide) is formed.

\Definition{Reaction rate}{The \textit{rate of a reaction} describes how quickly \textit{reactants are used up} or how quickly \textit{products are formed} during a chemical reaction. The units used are: moles per second (mols/second or mol.s$^{-1}$).
}

The average rate of a reaction is expressed as the number of
moles of reactant used up, divided by the total reaction time, or as the number of moles of product formed, divided by the reaction time. Using the magnesium reaction shown earlier:

\begin{equation*}
Average \ reaction \ rate \ of \ Mg = \frac{moles \ Mg \ used}{reaction \ time \ (s)}
\end{equation*}

\begin{center}
or
\end{center}

\begin{equation*}
Average \ reaction \ rate \ of \ O_{2} = \frac{moles \ O_{2} \ used}{reaction \ time \ (s)}
\end{equation*}

\begin{center}
or
\end{center}

\begin{equation*}
Average \ reaction \ rate \ of \ MgO = \frac{moles \ MgO \ produced}{reaction \ time \ (s)}
\end{equation*}

\begin{wex}{Reaction rates}{The following reaction takes place: 
\begin{center}
\rm${4Li + O_{2} \rightarrow 2Li_{2}O}$
\end{center}

After two minutes , 4 g of Lithium has been used up. Calculate the rate of the reaction.\\
}

{\westep{Calculate the number of moles of Lithium that are used up in the reaction.}

\begin{equation*}
n = \frac{m}{M} = \frac{4}{6.94} = 0.58 mols 
\end{equation*}
\westep{Calculate the time (in seconds) for the reaction.}

\begin{equation*}
t = 2 \times 60 = 120 s
\end{equation*}
\westep{Calculate the rate of the reaction.}

Rate of reaction = \begin{equation*} \frac{moles \ of \ Lithium \ used}{time} = \frac{0.58}{120} = 0.005\end{equation*} 

The rate of the reaction is 0.005 mol.s$^{-1}$

\section{Factors affecting reaction rates}
\label{sec:reactionrates:factors affecting}
Several factors affect the rate of a reaction. It is important to know
these factors so that reaction rates can be controlled. This is particularly important when it comes to industrial reactions, so that productivity can be maximised. The following are some of the factors that affect the rate of a reaction.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textbf{Nature of reactants}}

Substances have different chemical properties and therefore react differently and at different rates.

\item{\textbf{Concentration} (or \textbf{pressure} in the case of gases)}

As the concentration of the reactants increases, so does the reaction rate.

\item{\textbf{Temperature}}

If the temperature of the reaction increases, so does the rate of the reaction. 
	
\item{\textbf{Catalyst}} 

Adding a catalyst increases the reaction rate.

\item{\textbf{Surface area of solid reactants}} 

Increasing the surface area of the reactants (e.g. if a solid reactant is broken or ground up into smaller pieces) will increase the reaction rate. 
\end{enumerate}  

\Activity{Experiment}{The nature of reactants.\\}{

\Aim{

To determine the effect of the nature of reactants on the rate of a reaction.}

\Apparatus{

Oxalic acid ((COOH)$_{2}$), iron(II) sulphate (FeSO$_{4}$), potassium permanganate (KMnO$_{4}$), concentrated sulfuric acid (H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$), spatula, test tubes, medicine dropper, glass beaker and glass rod.}

\Method{

\begin{enumerate}
\item{In the first test tube, prepare an iron (II) sulphate solution by dissolving about two spatula points of iron (II) sulphate in 10 cm$^{3}$ of water.}
\item{In the second test tube, prepare a solution of oxalic acid in the same way.}
\item{Prepare a solution of sulfuric acid by adding 1 cm$^{3}$ of the concentrated acid to about 4 cm$^{3}$ of water. Remember always to add the \textit{acid to the water}, and never the other way around.}
\item{Add 2 cm$^{3}$ of the sulfuric acid solution to the iron(II)  and oxalic acid solutions respectively.}
\item{Using the medicine dropper, add a few drops of potassium permanganate to the two test tubes. Once you have done this, observe how quickly each solution discolours the potassium permanganate solution.\\} 
\end{enumerate}
}

\Results{

\begin{itemize}
\item{You should have seen that the oxalic acid solution discolours the potassium permanganate much more slowly than the iron(II) sulphate.}
\item{It is the oxalate ions (C$_{2}$O$_{4}^{2-}$) and the Fe$^{2+}$ ions that cause the discolouration. It is clear that the Fe$^{2+}$ ions act much more quickly than the C$_{2}$O$_{4}^{2-}$ ions. The reason for this is that there are no covalent bonds to be broken in the ions before the reaction can take place. In the case of the oxalate ions, covalent bonds between carbon and oxygen atoms must be broken first.}
\end{itemize}

\Conclusions{

The nature of the reactants can affect the rate of a reaction.}

\begin{IFact}{Oxalic acids are abundant in many plants. The leaves of the tea plant (\textit{Camellia sinensis}) contain very high concentrations of oxalic acid relative to other plants. Oxalic acid also occurs in small amounts in foods such as parsley, chocolate, nuts and berries. Oxalic acid irritates the lining of the gut when it is eaten, and can be fatal in very large doses.}

\Method{

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Prepare a solution of dilute hydrochloric acid in one of the beakers by diluting 1 part concentrated acid with 10 parts water. For example, if you measure 1 cm$^{3}$ of concentrated acid in a measuring cylinder and pour it into a beaker, you will need to add 10 cm$^{3}$ of water to the beaker as well. In the same way, if you pour 2 cm$^{3}$ of concentrated acid into a beaker, you will need to add 20 cm$^{3}$ of water. Both of these are 1:10 solutions. Pour 10 cm$^{3}$ of the 1:10 solution into a test tube and mark it 'A'. Remember to add the \textit{acid} to the \textit{water}, and not the other way around.} 
\item{Prepare a second solution of dilute hydrochloric acid by diluting 1 part concentrated acid with 20 parts water. Pour 10cm$^{3}$ of this 1:20 solution into a second test tube and mark it 'B'.}

\Conclusions{

The 1:10 solution is more concentrated and this reaction therefore proceeds faster. The greater the concentration of the reactants, the faster the rate of the reaction. The rate of the reaction can be measured by the rate at which hydrogen gas is produced.}

\section{Reaction rates and collision theory}

It should be clear now that the rate of a reaction varies depending on a number of factors. But how can we \textit{explain} why reactions take place at different speeds under different conditions? Why, for example, does an increase in the surface area of the reactants also increase the rate of the reaction? One way to explain this is to use \textbf{collision theory.}\\
 
For a reaction to occur, the particles that are reacting must collide with one another. Only a fraction of all the collisions that take place actually cause a chemical change. These are called 'successful' collisions. When there is an increase in the \textit{concentration} of reactants, the chance that reactant particles will collide with each other also increases because there are more particles in that space. In other words, the \textit{collision frequency} of the reactants increases. The number of \textit{successful} collisions will therefore also increase, and so will the rate of the reaction. In the same way, if the \textit{surface area} of the reactants increases, there is also a greater chance that successful collisions will occur.

\Definition{Collision theory}{Collision theory is a theory that explains how chemical reactions occur and why reaction rates differ for different reactions. The theory states that for a reaction to occur the reactant particles must collide, but that only a certain fraction of the total collisions, the \textit{effective collisions}, actually cause the reactant molecules to change into products. This is because only a small number of the molecules have enough energy and the right orientation at the moment of impact to break the existing bonds and form new bonds.}

When the \textit{temperature} of the reaction increases, the average kinetic energy of the reactant particles increases and they will move around much more actively. They are therefore more likely to collide with one another (Figure \ref{fig:reactionrates:collision}). Increasing the temperature also increases the number of particles whose energy will be greater than the activation energy for the reaction (refer section \ref{sec:reactionrates:energy}).

\section{Measuring Rates of Reaction}
\label{sec:reactionrates:measuring}

How the rate of a reaction is measured will depend on what the reaction is, and what product forms. Look back to the reactions that have been discussed so far. In each case, how was the rate of the reaction measured? The following examples will give you some ideas about other ways to measure the rate of a reaction:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textit{Reactions that produce hydrogen gas:} 

When a metal dissolves in an acid, hydrogen gas is produced. A lit splint can be used to test for hydrogen. The 'pop' sound shows that hydrogen is present. For example, magnesium reacts with sulfuric acid to produce magnesium sulphate and hydrogen.
}
\begin{center}
\rm${Mg(s) + H_{2}SO_{4} \rightarrow MgSO_{4} + H_{2}}$
\end{center}
 
\item{\textit{Reactions that produce carbon dioxide:} 

When a carbonate dissolves in an acid, carbon dioxide gas is produced. When carbon dioxide is passes through limewater, it turns the limewater milky. This is a simple test for the presence of carbon dioxide. For example, calcium carbonate reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce calcium chloride, water and carbon dioxide.
}
\begin{center}
\rm${CaCO_{3}(s) + 2HCl(aq) \rightarrow CaCl_{2}(aq) + H_{2}O(l) + CO_{2}(g)}$
\end{center}

\item{\textit{Reactions that produce gases such as oxygen or carbon dioxide:} 

Hydrogen peroxide decomposes to produce oxygen. The volume of oxygen produced can be measured using the gas syringe method (figure \ref {fig:reactionrates:gassyringe}). The gas collects in the syringe, pushing out against the plunger. The volume of gas that has been produced can be read from the markings on the syringe.

\item{\textit{Precipitate reactions:} 

In reactions where a \textit{precipitate} is formed, the amount of precipitate formed in a period of time can be used as a measure of the reaction rate. For example, when sodium thiosulphate reacts with an acid, a yellow precipitate of sulfur is formed. The reaction is as follows:}
\begin{center}
\rm${Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3}(aq) + 2HCl(aq) \rightarrow 2NaCl(aq) + SO_{2}(aq) + H_{2}O(l) + S(s)}$ 
\end{center}

One way to estimate the rate of this reaction is to carry out the investigation in a conical flask and to place a piece of paper with a black cross underneath the bottom of the flask. At the beginning of the reaction, the cross will be clearly visible when you look into the flask (figure \ref{fig:reactionrates:cross}). However, as the reaction progresses and more precipitate is formed, the cross will gradually become less clear and will eventually disappear altogether. Noting the time that it takes for this to happen will give an idea of the reaction rate. Note that it is not possible to collect the SO$_{2}$ gas that is produced in the reaction, because it is very soluble in water.

\item{\textit{Changes in mass:} 

The rate of a reaction that produces a gas can also be measured by calculating the mass loss as the gas is formed and escapes from the reaction flask. This method can be used for reactions that produce carbon dioxide or oxygen, but are not very accurate for reactions that give off hydrogen because the mass is too low for accuracy. Measuring changes in mass may also be suitable for other types of reactions.}

\section{Mechanism of reaction and catalysis}
\label{sec:reactionrates:energy}

Earlier it was mentioned that it is the \textit{collision} of particles that causes reactions to occur and that only some of these collisions are 'successful'. This is because the reactant particles have a wide range of kinetic energy, and only a small fraction of the particles will have enough energy to actually break bonds so that a chemical reaction can take place. The minimum energy that is needed for a reaction to take place is called the \textbf{activation energy}. For more information on the energy of reactions, refer to Grade 11.

\Definition{Activation energy}{The energy that is needed to break the bonds in reactant molecules so that a chemical reaction can proceed.}

Even at a fixed temperature, the energy of the particles varies, meaning that only some of them will have enough energy to be part of the chemical reaction, depending on the activation energy for that reaction. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:reactionrates:particle energy distribution}. Increasing the reaction temperature has the effect of increasing the number of particles with enough energy to take part in the reaction, and so the reaction rate increases.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

A \textbf{catalyst} functions slightly differently. The function of a catalyst is to lower the activation energy so that more particles now have enough energy to react. The catalyst itself is not changed during the reaction, but simply provides an alternative pathway for the reaction, so that it needs less energy. Some \textit{metals} e.g. platinum, copper and iron can act as catalysts in certain reactions. In our own human bodies, \textit{enzymes} are catalysts that help to speed up biological reactions. Catalysts generally react with one or more of the reactants to form a chemical intermediate which then reacts to form the final product. The chemical intermediate is sometimes called the \textbf{activated complex}. \\

The following is an example of how a reaction that involves a catalyst might proceed. C represents the catalyst, A and B are reactants and D is the product of the reaction of A and B.\\

\textbf{Step 1:} A + C $\rightarrow$ AC 
 
\textbf{Step 2:} B + AC $\rightarrow$ ABC  

\textbf{Step 3:} ABC $\rightarrow$ CD 

\textbf{Step 4:} CD $\rightarrow$ C + D\\

In the above, ABC represents the intermediate chemical. Although the catalyst (C) is consumed by reaction 1, it is later produced again by reaction 4, so that the overall reaction is as follows:

\begin{center}
A + B + C $\rightarrow$ D + C 
\end{center}

You can see from this that the catalyst is released at the end of the reaction, completely unchanged.

\Definition{Catalyst}{A catalyst speeds up a chemical reaction, without being altered in any way. It increases the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy for a reaction.}

Energy diagrams are useful to illustrate the effect of a \textbf{catalyst} on reaction rates. Catalysts decrease the activation energy required for a reaction to proceed (shown by the smaller 'hump' on the energy diagram in figure \ref{fig:reactionrates:catalyst}), and therefore increase the reaction rate.

\section{Chemical equilibrium}
\label{sec:reactionrates:equilibrium}

Having looked at factors that affect the rate of a reaction, we now need to ask some important questions. Does a reaction always proceed in the same direction or can it be reversible? In other words, is it always true that a reaction proceeds from \textit{reactants to products}, or is it possible that sometimes, the reaction will reverse and the \textit{products will be changed back into the reactants}? And does a reaction always run its full course so that all the reactants are used up, or can a reaction reach a point where reactants are still present, but there does not seem to be any further change taking place in the reaction? The following demonstration might help to explain this.

\Activity{Demonstration}{Liquid-vapour phase equilibrium\\}{

\textbf{Apparatus and materials:\\}

2 beakers; water; bell jar\\

\textbf{Method:\\}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Half fill two beakers with water and mark the level of the water in each case.}
\item{Cover one of the beakers with a bell jar.}
\item{Leave the beakers and, over the course of a day or two, observe how the water level in the two beakers changes. What do you notice? Note: You could speed up this demonstration by placing the two beakers over a bunsen burner to heat the water. In this case, it may be easier to cover the second beaker with a glass cover.\\}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Observations:\\}

You should notice that in the beaker that is uncovered, the water level drops quickly because of evaporation. In the beaker that is covered, there is an initial drop in the water level, but after a while evaporation appears to stop and the water level in this beaker is higher than that in the one that is open. Note that the diagram below shows the situation ate time=0. \\

\textbf{Discussion:\\}

In the first beaker, liquid water becomes water vapour as a result of evaporation and the water level drops. In the second beaker, evaporation also takes place. However, in this case, the vapour comes into contact with the surface of the bell jar and it cools and condenses to form liquid water again. This water is returned to the beaker. Once condensation has begun, the rate at which water is lost from the beaker will start to decrease. At some point, the rate of evaporation will be equal to the rate of condensation above the beaker, and there will be no change in the water level in the beaker. This can be represented as follows:

\begin{center}
\rm${liquid \rightleftharpoons vapour}$
\end{center}

In this example, the reaction (in this case, a change in the phase of water) can proceed in either direction. In one direction there is a change in phase from liquid to vapour. But the reverse can also take place, when vapour condenses to form water again. 
}   

In a \textbf{closed system} it is possible for reactions to be reversible, such as in the demonstration above. In a closed system, it is also possible for a chemical reaction to reach \textbf{equilibrium}. We will discuss these concepts in more detail.

\subsection{Open and closed systems}

An \textbf{open system} is one in which matter or energy can flow into or out of the system. In the liquid-vapour demonstration we used, the first beaker was an example of an open system because the beaker could be heated or cooled (a change in \textit{energy}), and water vapour (the \textit{matter}) could evaporate from the beaker. \\

A \textbf{closed system} is one in which energy can enter or leave, but matter cannot. The second beaker covered by the bell jar is an example of a closed system. The beaker can still be heated or cooled, but water vapour cannot leave the system because the bell jar is a barrier. Condensation changes the vapour to liquid and returns it to the beaker. In other words, there is no loss of matter from the system. \\

\Definition{Open and closed systems}{
An \textit{open system} is one whose borders allow the movement of energy and matter into and out of the system. A \textit{closed system} is one in which only energy can be exchanged, but not matter.
}

\subsection{Reversible reactions}
Some reactions can take place in two directions. In one direction the reactants combine to form the products. This is called the \textbf{forward reaction}. In the other, the products react to form reactants again. This is called the \textbf{reverse reaction}. A special double-headed arrow is used to show this type of \textbf{reversible reaction}:

\begin{center}
$ XY + Z \rightleftharpoons X + YZ $
\end{center}

So, in the following reversible reaction:
\begin{center}
\rm${H_{2}(g) + I_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2HI (g)}$
\end{center}

The forward reaction is ${H_{2}(g) + I_{2}(g) \rightarrow 2HI(g)}$. The reverse reaction is ${2HI(g) \rightarrow H_{2}(g) + I_{2}(g)}$.

\Definition{A reversible reaction}{A reversible reaction is a chemical reaction that can proceed in both the forward and reverse directions. In other words, the reactant and product of one reaction may reverse roles.}

\textbf{Discussion:}\\

\begin{itemize}
\item{If you look at the last two equations you will see that the one is the reverse of the other. In other words, this is a \textit{reversible reaction} and can be written as follows:
\begin{center}
\rm${CaCO_{3}(s) + H_{2}O + CO_{2} \rightleftharpoons Ca(HCO_{3})_{2}}$
\end{center}
}
\item{Is the forward reaction endothermic or exothermic? Is the reverse reaction endothermic or exothermic? You should have noticed that the reverse reaction only took place when the solution was heated. Sometimes, changing the temperature of a reaction can change its direction.}
\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Chemical equilibrium}

Using the same reversible reaction that we used in an earlier example:

\begin{center}
\rm${H_{2}(g) + I_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2HI (g)}$
\end{center}

The forward reaction is:

\begin{equation*}
H_{2} + I_{2} \rightarrow 2HI
\end{equation*}

The reverse reaction is:

\begin{equation*}
2HI \rightarrow H_{2} + I_{2}
\end{equation*}

When the rate of the forward reaction and the reverse reaction are equal, the system is said to be in \textbf{equilbrium}. Figure \ref{fig:reactionrates:equilibrium} shows this. Initially (time = 0), the rate of the forward reaction is high and the rate of the reverse reaction is low. As the reaction proceeds, the rate of the forward reaction decreases and the rate of the reverse reaction increases, until both occur at the same rate. This is called equilibrium. \\

Although it is not always possible to observe any macroscopic changes, this does not mean that the reaction has stopped. The forward and reverse reactions continue to take place and so microscopic changes still occur in the system. This state is called \textbf{dynamic equilibrium}. In the liquid-vapour phase equilibrium demonstration, dynamic equilibrium was reached when there was no observable change in the level of the water in the second beaker even though evaporation and condensation continued to take place.

There are, however, a number of factors that can change the chemical equilibrium of a reaction. Changing the \textbf{concentration}, the \textbf{temperature} or the \textbf{pressure} of a reaction can affect equilibrium. These factors will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

\Definition{Chemical equilibrium}{
Chemical equilibrium is the state of a chemical reaction, where the concentrations of the reactants and products have no net change over time. Usually, this state results when the forward chemical reactions proceed at the same rate as their reverse reactions.

\section{The equilibrium constant}

\Definition{Equilibrium constant}{
The equilibrium constant (K$_{c}$), relates to a chemical reaction at equilibrium. It can be calculated if the equilibrium concentration of each reactant and product in a reaction at equilibrium is known.
}

\subsection{Calculating the equilibrium constant}

Consider the following generalised reaction which takes place in a \textbf{closed} container at a \textbf{constant temperature}:
\begin{center}
\rm${A + B \rightleftharpoons C + D}$ 
\end{center}

We know from section \ref{sec:reactionrates:factors affecting} that the rate of the forward reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactants. In other words, as the concentration of the reactants increases, so does the rate of the forward reaction. This can be shown using the following equation:
\begin{center}
Rate of forward reaction $\propto$ [A][B] 

or

Rate of forward reaction = k$_{1}$[A][B]
\end{center}

Similarly, the rate of the reverse reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the products. This can be shown using the following equation:
\begin{center}
Rate of reverse reaction $\propto$ [C][D]

or

Rate of reverse reaction = k$_{2}$[C][D]
\end{center}

At equilibrium, the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction. This can be shown using the following equation:

\begin{equation*}
k_{1}[A][B] = k_{2}[C][D]
\end{equation*}

\begin{center}
or
\end{center}

\begin{equation*}
\frac{k_{1}}{k_{2}} = \frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]}
\end{equation*}

or, if the constants k$_{1}$ and k$_{2}$ are simplified to a single constant, the equation becomes:

\begin{equation*}
k_{c} = \frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]} 
\end{equation*}

A more general form of the equation for a reaction at chemical equilibrium is:
\begin{center}
${aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD}$
\end{center}

where A and B are reactants, C and D are products and a, b, c, and d are the coefficients of the respective reactants and products. A more general formula for calculating the equilibrium constant is therefore:

\begin{equation*}
K_{c} = \frac{[C]^{c}[D]^{d}}{[A]^{a}[B]^{b}} 
\end{equation*}

It is important to note that if a reactant or a product in a chemical reaction is in either the \textbf{liquid} or \textbf{solid} phase, the concentration stays constant during the reaction. Therefore, these values can be left out of the equation to calculate K$_{c}$. For example, in the following reaction:\\

\begin{center}
\rm${C(s) + H_{2}O(g) \rightleftharpoons CO(g) + H_{2}(g)}$
\end{center}

\begin{equation*}
K_{c} = \frac{[CO][H_{2}]}{[H_{2}O]}
\end{equation*}

\Tip{

\begin{enumerate}
\item{The constant $K_{c}$ is affected by temperature and so, if the values of $K_{c}$ are being compared for different reactions, it is important that all the reactions have taken place at the same temperature.}
\item{K$_{c}$ values do not have units. If you look at the equation, the units all cancel each other out.}
\end{enumerate}
}

\subsection{The meaning of K$_{c}$ values}

The formula for K$_{c}$ has the concentration of the products in the numerator and the concentration of reactants in the denominator. So a \textit{high K$_{c}$} value means that the concentration of products is high and the reaction has a high yield. We can also say that the equilibrium lies far to the right. The opposite is true for a low K$_{c}$ value. A \textit{low K$_{c}$ value} means that, at equilibrium, there are more reactants than products and therefore the yield is low. The equilibrium for the reaction lies far to the left.

\Tip{Calculations made easy\\}{
When you are busy with calculations that involve the equilibrium constant, the following tips may help:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item{
Make sure that you always read the question carefully to be sure of what you are being asked to calculate. If the equilibrium constant is involved, make sure that the concentrations you use are the concentrations \textbf{at equilibrium}, and not the concentrations or quantities that are present at some other time in the reaction. 
}

\item{When you are doing more complicated calculations, it sometimes helps to draw up a table like the one below and fill in the \textbf{mole values} that you know or those you can calculate. This will give you a clear picture of what is happening in the reaction and will make sure that you use the right values in your calculations.

\section{Le Chatelier's principle}
\label{sec:reactionrates:lechatelier}

A number of factors can influence the equilibrium of a reaction. These are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item concentration
\item temperature
\item pressure
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Le Chatelier's Principle} helps to predict what a change in temperature, concentration or pressure will have on the position of the equilibrium in a chemical reaction. This is very important, particularly in industrial applications, where yields must be accurately predicted and maximised.

\Definition{Le Chatelier's Principle}{If a chemical system at equilibrium experiences a change in concentration, temperature or total pressure the equilibrium will shift in order to minimise that change and a new equilibrium is established.}

\subsection{The effect of concentration on equilibrium}

If the concentration of a substance is increased, the equilibrium will shift so that this concentration decreases. So for example, if the concentration of a reactant was increased, the equilibrium would shift in the direction of the reaction that \textit{uses up} the reactants, so that the reactant concentration decreases and equilibrium is restored. In the reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia:

\begin{center}
\rm${N_{2}(g) + 3H_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2NH_{3}(g)}$ 
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item{If the nitrogen or hydrogen concentration was increased, Le Chatelier's principle predicts that equilibrium will shift to favour the \textit{forward reaction} so that the excess nitrogen and hydrogen are used up to produce ammonia. Equilibrium shifts to the \textit{right}.} 

\item{If the nitrogen or hydrogen concentration was decreased, the \textit{reverse reaction} would be favoured so that some of the ammonia would change back to nitrogen and hydrogen to restore equilibrium.}

\item{The same would be true if the concentration of the product (NH$_{3}$) was changed. If [NH$_{3}$] decreases, the forward reaction is favoured and if [NH$_{3}$] increases, the reverse reaction is favoured.}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The effect of temperature on equilibrium}

If the temperature of a reaction mixture is increased, the equilibrium will shift to decrease the temperature. So
it will favour the reaction which will \textit{use up} heat energy, in other words the endothermic reaction. The opposite is true if the temperature is decreased. In this case, the reaction that \textit{produces} heat energy will be favoured, in other words, the exothermic reaction.\\

The reaction shown below is exothermic (shown by the negative value for $\Delta$ H). This means that the forward reaction, where nitrogen and hydrogen react to form ammonia, gives off heat. In the reverse reaction, where ammonia is broken down into hydrogen and nitrogen gas, heat is used up and so this reaction is endothermic.

\begin{eqnarray*}
  & e.g. & N_{2}(g) + 3H_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons  2NH_{3}(g) \ \rm{and} \
  \Delta H = -92kJ
\end{eqnarray*}

An increase in temperature favours the reaction that is endothermic (the reverse reaction) because it uses up energy. If the temperature is increased, then the yield of ammonia (NH$_{3}$) decreases. \\

A decrease in temperature favours the reaction that is exothermic (the forward reaction) because it produces energy. Therefore, if the temperature is decreased, then the yield of NH$_{3}$ increases. \\

Use your knowledge of equilibrium principles to explain the changes that you recorded in the table above. Draw a conclusion about the effect of a change in concentration of either the reactants or products on the equilibrium position. Also draw a conclusion about the effect of a change in temperature on the equilibrium position.}
}

\subsection{The effect of pressure on equilibrium}

In the case of gases, we refer to pressure instead of concentration. Similar principles apply as those that were described before for concentration. When the pressure of a system increases, there are more particles in a particular space. The equilibrium will shift in a direction that reduces the number of gas particles so that the pressure is also reduced. To predict what will happen in a reaction, we need to look at the number of moles of gas that are in the reactants and products. Look at the example below:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  & e.g. & 2SO_{2}(g) + O_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2SO_{3}(g)
\end{eqnarray*}

In this reaction, two moles of product are formed for every three moles of reactants. If we increase the pressure on the closed system, the equilibrium will shift to the right because the forward reaction reduces the number of moles of gas that are present. This means that the yield of SO$_{3}$ will increase. The opposite will apply if the pressure on the system decreases. the equilibrium will shift to the left, and the concentration of SO$_{2}$ and O$_{2}$ will increase. 

\Tip{
The following rules will help in predicting the changes that take place in equilibrium reactions:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item{If the forward reaction that forms the product is endothermic, then an increase in temperature will favour this reaction and the yield of product will increase. Lowering the temperature will decrease the product yield.}

\item{If the forward reaction that forms the product is exothermic, then a decrease in temperature will favour this reaction and the product yield will increase. Increasing the temperature will decrease the product yield.}

\item{Increasing the pressure favours the side of the equilibrium with the least number of gas molecules. This is shown in the balanced symbol equation. This rule applies in reactions with one or more gaseous reactants or products.}

\item{Decreasing the pressure favours the side of the equilibrium with the most number of gas molecules. This rule applies in reactions with one or more gaseous reactants or products.}

\item{If the concentration of a reactant (on the left) is increased, then some of it must change to the products (on the right) for equilibrium to be maintained. The equilibrium position will shift to the right.}

\item{If the concentration of a reactant (on the left) is decreased, then some of  the products (on the right) must change back to reactants for equilibrium to be maintained. The equilibrium position will shift to the left.}

\item{A \textbf{catalyst} does not affect the equilibrium position of a reaction. It only influences the \textit{rate of the reaction}, in other words, how quickly equilibrium is reached.}

\item{During a classroom experiment copper metal reacts with concentrated nitric acid to produce NO$_{2}$ gas, which is collected in a gas syringe.

\begin{equation*}
2NO_{2} (g) \rightleftharpoons N_{2}O_{4} (g)

\section{Industrial applications}
\label{sec:reactionrates:industrial}

The \textbf{Haber process} is a good example of an industrial process which uses the equilibrium principles that have been discussed. The equation for the process is as follows:

\begin{equation*}
N_{2}(g) + 3H_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2NH_{3}(g) + energy 
\end{equation*}

Since the reaction is \textbf{exothermic}, the forward reaction is favoured at low temperatures, and the reverse reaction at high temperatures. If the purpose of the Haber process is to produce ammonia, then the temperature must be maintained at a level that is low enough to ensure that the reaction continues in the forward direction.\\

The forward reaction is also favoured by high \textit{pressures} because there are four moles of reactant for every two moles of product formed.\\

The K value for this reaction will be calculated as follows:

\begin{equation*}
K = \frac{[NH_{3}]^{2}}{[N_{2}][H_{2}]^{3}}
\end{equation*}

\Exercise{Applying equilibrium principles\\}{

Look at the values of k calculated for the Haber process reaction at different temperatures, and then answer the questions that follow:\\

\summary{aaa}

\begin{itemize}
\item{The \textbf{rate of a reaction} describes how quickly reactants are used up, or how quickly products form. The units used are moles per second.}
\item{A number of factors can affect the rate of a reaction. These include the \textbf{nature of the reactants}, the \textbf{concentration} of reactants, \textbf{temperature} of the reaction, the presence or absence of a \textbf{catalyst} and the \textbf{surface area} of the reactants.}
\item{\textbf{Collision theory} provides one way of explaining why each of these factors can affect the rate of a reaction. For example, higher temperatures mean increased reaction rates because the reactant particles have more energy and are more likely to collide successfully with each other.}
\item{Different methods can be used to \textbf{measure the rate of a reaction}. The method used will depend on the nature of the product. Reactions that produce gases can be measured by collecting the gas in a syringe. Reactions that produce a precipitate are also easy to measure because the precipitate is easily visible.}
\item{For any reaction to occur, a minimum amount of energy is needed so that bonds in the reactants can break, and new bonds can form in the products. The minimum energy that is required is called the \textbf{activation energy} of a reaction.}
\item{In reactions where the particles do not have enough energy to overcome this activation energy, one of two methods can be used to facilitate a reaction to take place: increase the temperature of the reaction or add a catalyst.}
\item{\textbf{Increasing the temperature of a reaction} means that the average energy of the reactant particles increases and they are more likely to have enough energy to overcome the activation energy.}
\item{A \textbf{catalyst} is used to lower the activation energy so that the reaction is more likely to take place. A catalyst does this by providing an alternative, lower energy pathway, for the reaction.}
\item{A catalyst therefore \textbf{speeds up a reaction} but does not become part of the reaction in any way.}
\item{\textbf{Chemical equilibrium} is the state of a reaction, where the concentrations of the reactants and the products have no net change over time. Usually this occurs when the rate of the forward reaction is the same as the rate of the reverse reaction.}
\item{The \textbf{equilibrium constant} relates to reactions at equilibrium, and can be calculated using the following equation:

\begin{equation*}
K_{c} = \frac{[C]^{c}[D]^{d}}{[A]^{a}[B]^{b}} 
\end{equation*}

where A and B are reactants, C and D are products and a, b, c, and d are the coefficients of the respective reactants and products. }
\item{A \textbf{high K$_{c}$ value} means that the concentration of products at equilibrium is high and the reaction has a high yield. A \textbf{low K$_{c}$ value} means that the concentration of products at equilibrium is low and the reaction has a low yield.}
\item{\textbf{Le Chatelier's Principle} states that if a chemical system at equilibrium experiences a change in concentration, temperature or total pressure the equilibrium will shift in order to minimise that change and to re-establish equilibrium. For example, if the pressure of a gaseous system at eqilibrium was increased, the equilibrium would shift to favour the reaction that produces the lowest quantity of the gas. If the temperature of the same system was to increase, the equilibrium would shift to favour the endothermic reaction. Similar principles apply for changes in concentration of the reactants or products in a reaction.}
\item{The principles of equilibrium are very important in \textbf{industrial applications} such as the Haber process, so that productivity can be maximised.}
