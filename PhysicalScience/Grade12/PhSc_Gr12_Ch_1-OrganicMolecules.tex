\section{What is organic chemistry?}
\label{sec:om:hist}

\textbf{Organic chemistry} is the branch of chemistry that deals with \textbf{organic molecules}. An organic molecule is one which contains \textbf{carbon}, and these molecules can range in size from simple molecules to complex structures containing thousands of atoms! Although carbon is present in all organic compounds, other elements such as hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulphur (S) and phosphorus (P) are also common in these molecules.

Until the early nineteenth century, chemists had managed to make many simple compounds in the laboratory, but were still unable to produce the complex molecules that they found in living organisms. It was around this time that a Swedish chemist called \textbf{Jons Jakob Berzelius} suggested that compounds found only in living organisms (the organic compounds) should be grouped separately from those found in the non-living world (the inorganic compounds). He also suggested that the laws that governed how organic compounds formed, were different from those for inorganic compounds. From this, the idea developed that there was a 'vital force' in organic compounds. In other words, scientists believed that organic compounds would not follow the normal physical and chemical laws that applied to other inorganic compounds because the very 'force of life' made them different.

This idea of a mystical 'vital force' in organic compounds was weakened when scientists began to manufacture organic compounds in the laboratory from non-living materials. One of the first to do this was \textbf{Friedrich Wohler} in 1828, who successfully prepared urea, an organic compound in the urine of animals which, until that point, had only been found in animals. A few years later a student of Wohler's, \textbf{Hermann Kolbe}, made the organic compound \textit{acetic acid} from inorganic compounds. By this stage it was acknowledged that organic compounds are governed by exactly the same laws that apply to inorganic compounds. The properties of organic compounds are not due to a 'vital force' but to the unique properties of the carbon atom itself.\\

Organic compounds are very important in daily life. They make up a big part of our own bodies, they are in the food we eat and in the clothes we wear. Organic compounds are also used to make products such as medicines, plastics, washing powders, dyes, along with a list of other items.

\section{Sources of carbon}
\label{sec:om:sources}

The main source of the carbon in organic compounds is \textbf{carbon dioxide} in the air. Plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into organic compounds through the process of \textbf{photosynthesis}. Plants are therefore able to make their own organic compounds through photosynthesis, while animals feed on plants or plant products so that they gain the organic compounds that they need to survive. \\

Another important source of carbon is \textbf{fossil fuels} such as coal, petroleum and natural gas. This is because fossil fuels are themselves formed from the decaying remains of dead organisms (refer to Grade 11 for more information on fossil fuels).

\section{Unique properties of carbon}
\label{sec:om:properties}

Carbon has a number of unique properties which influence how it behaves and how it bonds with other atoms:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Carbon has \textit{four valence electrons} which means that each carbon atom can form four bonds with other atoms. Because of this, long \textit{chain structures} can form. These chains can either be \textit{unbranched} (figure \ref{fig:organic:unbranched}) or \textit{branched} (figure \ref{fig:organic:branched}). Because of the number of bonds that carbon can form with other atoms, organic compounds can be very complex.

\item{Because of its position on the Periodic Table, most of the bonds that carbon forms with other atoms are \textit{covalent}. Think for example of a C-C bond. The difference in electronegativity between the two atoms is zero, so this is a pure covalent bond. In the case of a C-H bond, the difference in electronegativity between carbon (2.5) and hydrogen (2.1) is so small that C-H bonds are almost purely covalent. The result of this is that most organic compounds are non-polar. This affects some of the properties of organic compounds.}

\section{Representing organic compounds}
\label{sec:organic:representing}

There are a number of ways to represent organic compounds. It is useful to know all of these so that you can recognise a molecule however it is shown. There are three main ways of representing a compound. We will use the example of a molecule called 2-methylpropane to help explain the difference between each.

\subsection{Molecular formula}

The molecular formula of a compound shows how many atoms of each type are in a molecule. The number of each atom is written as a subscript after the atomic symbol. The molecular formula of 2-methylpropane is:

\begin{center}
\textbf{C$_{4}$H$_{10}$}
\end{center}


\subsection{Structural formula}

The structural formula of an organic compound shows every bond between every atom in the molecule. Each bond is represented by a line. The structural formula of 2-methylpropane is shown in figure \ref{fig:organic:structural formula}.

\begin{figure}[h]

\psline(0.3,2)(0.7,2)
\end{pspicture}
\caption{The structural formula of 2-methylpropane}
\label{fig:organic:structural formula}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Condensed structural formula}

When a compound is represented using its condensed structural formula, each carbon atom and the hydrogen atoms that are bonded directly to it are listed as a molecular formula, followed by a similar molecular formula for the neighbouring carbon atom. Branched groups are shown in brackets after the carbon atom to which they are bonded. The condensed structural formula below shows that in 2-methylpropane, there is a branched chain attached to the second carbon atom of the main chain. You can check this by looking at the structural formula in figure \ref{fig:organic:structural formula}.

If you were to count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in each compound, you would find that they are the same. They both have the same molecular formula (C$_{4}$H$_{10}$), but their structure is different and so are their properties. Such compounds are called \textbf{isomers}.

In chemistry, isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula and often with the same kinds of chemical bonds between atoms, but in which the atoms are arranged differently.

\section{Functional groups}
\label{sec:organic:functional}

All organic compounds have a particular bond or group of atoms which we call its \textbf{functional group}. This group is important in determining how a compound will react. 

\Definition{Functional group}{
In organic chemistry, a functional group is a specific group of atoms within molecules, that are responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions of those molecules. The same functional group will undergo the same or similar chemical reaction(s) regardless of the size of the molecule it is a part of.
}

In one group of organic compounds called the \textbf{hydrocarbons}, the single, double and triple bonds of the alkanes, alkenes and alkynes are examples of functional groups. In another group, the alcohols, an oxygen and a hydrogen atom   are bonded to each other to form the functional group for those compounds (in other words an alcohol has an OH in it). All alcohols will contain an oxygen and a hydrogen atom bonded together in some part of the molecule. \\

Table \ref{fig:om:summary} summarises some of the common functional groups. We will look at these in more detail later in this chapter.

\section{The Hydrocarbons}
\label{sec:organic:hydrocarbons}

Let us first look at a group of organic compounds known as the \textbf{hydrocarbons}. These molecules only contain carbon and hydrogen. The hydrocarbons that we are going to look at are called \textbf{aliphatic compounds}. The aliphatic compounds are divided into \textit{acyclic compounds} (chain structures) and \textit{cyclic compounds} (ring structures). The chain structures are further divided into structures that contain only \textit{single bonds} (\textbf{alkanes}), those that contain at least one \textit{double bond} (\textbf{alkenes}) and those that contain at least one \textit{triple bond} (\textbf{alkynes}). Cyclic compounds include structures such as the \textit{benzene ring}. Figure \ref{fig:om:classhydro} summarises the classification of the hydrocarbons. \\

Hydrocarbons that contain only single bonds are called \textbf{saturated} hydrocarbons because each carbon atom is bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible. Figure \ref{fig:organic:saturated} shows a molecule of ethane which is a saturated hydrocarbon.\\

\end{figure}

Hydrocarbons that contain double or triple bonds are called \textbf{unsaturated} hydrocarbons because they don't contain as many hydrogen atoms as possible. Figure \ref{fig:organic:unsaturated} shows a molecule of ethene which is an unsaturated hydrocarbon. If you compare the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in a molecule of ethane and a molecule of ethene, you will see that the number of hydrogen atoms in ethene is \textit{less} than the number of hydrogen atoms in ethane despite the fact that they both contain two carbon atoms. In order for an unsaturated compound to become saturated, a double bond has to be broken, and another two hydrogen atoms added for each double bond that is replaced by a single bond.

%Fat that occurs naturally in living matter such as animals and plants is used as food for human consumption and contains varying proportions of saturated and unsaturated fat. Foods that contain a high proportion of saturated fat are butter, ghee, suet, tallow, lard, coconut oil, cottonseed oil, palm kernel oil, dairy products (especially cream and cheese), meat, and some prepared foods. Diets high in saturated fat are correlated with an increased incidence of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease according to a number of studies. Vegetable oils contain unsaturated fats and can be hardened to form margarine by adding hydrogen on to some of the double bonds using a nickel catalyst. The process is called hydrogenation

We will now go on to look at each of the acyclic, aliphatic hydrocarbon groups in more detail. These groups are the alkanes, the alkenes and the alkynes.

\subsection{The Alkanes}

The alkanes are hydrocarbons that only contain \textit{single covalent bonds} between their carbon atoms. This means that they are \textit{saturated} compounds and are quite unreactive. The simplest alkane has only one carbon atom and is called \textbf{methane}. This molecule is shown in figure \ref{fig:organic:methane}.

When you look at the molecular formula for each of the alkanes, you should notice a pattern developing. For each carbon atom that is added to the molecule, two hydrogen atoms are added. In other words, each molecule differs from the one before it by CH$_{2}$. This is called a \textit{homologous series}. The alkanes have the general formula C$_{n}$H$_{2n+2}$.

\begin{IFact}{Some fungi use alkanes as a source of carbon and energy. One fungus \textit{Amorphotheca resinae} prefers the alkanes used in aviation fuel, and this can cause problems for aircraft in tropical areas!}
\end{IFact}

The alkanes are the most important source of fuel in the world and are used extensively in the chemical industry. Some are gases (e.g.\@ methane and ethane), while others are liquid fuels (e.g.\@ octane, an important component of petrol).



\subsection{Naming the alkanes}

In order to give compounds a name, certain rules must be followed. When naming organic compounds, the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) nomenclature (naming scheme) is used. We will first look at some of the steps that need to be followed when naming a compound, and then try to apply these rules to some specific examples.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Step \arabic*}:]
\item{Recognise the \textit{functional group} in the compound. This will determine the suffix (the 'end') of the name. For example, if the compound is an alkane, the suffix will be -ane; if the compound is an alkene the suffix will be -ene; if the compound is an alcohol the suffix will be -ol, and so on.}
\item{Find the longest continuous carbon chain (it won't always be a \textit{straight} chain) and count the number of carbon atoms in this chain. This number will determine the prefix (the 'beginning') of the compound's name. These prefixes are shown in table \ref{tab:prefix}.

\subsection{Properties of the alkanes}

We have already mentioned that the alkanes are relatively unreactive because of their stable C-C and C-H bonds. The boiling point and melting point of these molecules is determined by their molecular structure, and their surface area. The more carbon atoms there are in an alkane, the greater the surface area and therefore the higher the boiling point. The melting point also increases as the number of carbon atoms in the molecule increases. This can be seen in the data in table \ref{fig:alkane properties}.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|c|c|}\hline
\textbf{Formula} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Melting point ($\degree$C)} & \textbf{Boiling point ($\degree$C)} & \textbf{Phase at room temperature}\\\hline
CH$_{4}$ & methane & $-183$ & $-162$ & gas\\\hline
C$_{2}$H$_{6}$ & ethane & $-182$ & $-88$  & gas\\\hline
C$_{3}$H$_{8}$ & propane & $-187$ & $-45$ & gas \\\hline
C$_{4}$H$_{10}$ & butane & $-138$ & $-0.5$ & gas \\\hline
C$_{5}$H$_{12}$ & pentane & $-130$ & $36$ & liquid \\\hline
C$_{6}$H$_{14}$ & hexane & $-95$ & $69$ & liquid \\\hline
C$_{17}$H$_{36}$ & heptadecane & $22$ & $302$ & solid \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Properties of some of the alkanes}
\label{fig:alkane properties}
\end{center}
\end{table}

You will also notice that, when the molecular mass of the alkanes is low (i.e.\@ there are few carbon atoms), the organic compounds are \textit{gases} because the intermolecular forces are weak. As the number of carbon atoms and the molecular mass increases, the compounds are more likely to be liquids or solids because the intermolecular forces are stronger.

\subsection{Reactions of the alkanes}

There are three types of reactions that can occur in saturated compounds such as the alkanes.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textbf{Substitution reactions}

Substitution reactions involve the removal of a hydrogen atom which is replaced by an atom of another element, such as a halogen (F, Cl, Br or I) (figure \ref{fig:organic:substitution}). The product is called a \textbf{halo-alkane}. Since alkanes are not very reactive, either heat or light is needed for this reaction to take place.\\

e.g.\@ CH$_{2}$=CH$_{2}$ + HBr \rm${\rightarrow}$ CH$_{3}$-CH$_{2}$-Br (halo-alkane)

Halo-alkanes (also sometimes called \textit{alkyl halides}) that contain methane and chlorine are substances that can be used as anaesthetics during operations. One example is trichloromethane, also known as 'chloroform' (figure \ref{fig:om:chloroform}).

When alkanes are burnt in air, they react with the oxygen in air and heat is produced. This is called an \textbf{oxidation} or combustion reaction. Carbon dioxide and water are given off as products. Heat is also released during the reaction. The burning of alkanes provides most of the energy that is used by man.\\

\item{Methane is one of the simplest alkanes and yet it is an important fuel source. Methane occurs naturally in wetlands, natural gas and permafrost. However, methane can also be produced when organic wastes (e.g.\@ animal manure and decaying material) are broken down by bacteria under conditions that are anaerobic (there is no oxygen). The simplified reaction is shown below:

\begin{center}
Organic matter ${\rightarrow}$ Simple organic acids ${\rightarrow}$ Biogas
\end{center}

The organic matter could be carbohydrates, proteins or fats which are broken down by acid-forming bacteria into simple organic acids such as acetic acid or formic acid. Methane-forming bacteria then convert these acids into biogases such as methane and ammonia.\\

The production of methane in this way is very important because methane can be used as a fuel source. One of the advantages of methane over other fuels like coal, is that it produces more energy but with lower carbon dioxide emissions. The problem however, is that methane itself is a greenhouse gas and has a much higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide. So, producing methane may in fact have an even more dangerous impact on the environment.

\subsection{The alkenes}

In the alkenes, there is at least one double bond between two carbon atoms. This means that they are \textbf{unsaturated} and are \textit{more reactive} than the alkanes. The simplest alkene is ethene (also known as ethylene), which is shown in figure \ref{fig:om:ethene3rep}.

As with the alkanes, the alkenes also form a homologous series. They have the general formula C$_{n}$H$_{2n}$. The second alkene in the series would therefore be C$_{3}$H$_{6}$. This molecule is known as propene (figure \ref{fig:om:propene3rep}). Note that if an alkene has two double bonds, it is called a \textbf{diene} and if it has three double bonds it is called a \textbf{triene}.

The alkenes have a variety of uses. Ethylene for example is a hormone in plants that stimulates the ripening of fruits and the opening of flowers. Propene is an important compound in the petrochemicals industry. It is used as a monomer to make polypropylene and is also used as a fuel gas for other industrial processes. 

\subsection{Naming the alkenes}

Similar rules will apply in naming the alkenes, as for the alkanes.

\subsection{The properties of the alkenes}

The properties of the alkenes are very similar to those of the alkanes, except that the alkenes are more reactive because they are unsaturated. As with the alkanes, compounds that have four or less carbon atoms are gases at room temperature, while those with five or more carbon atoms are liquids.

\subsection{Reactions of the alkenes}

Alkenes can undergo \textbf{addition reactions} because they are unsaturated. They readily react with hydrogen, water and the halogens. The double bond is broken and a single, saturated bond is formed. A new group is then added to one or both of the carbon atoms that previously made up the double bond. The following are some examples:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textbf{Hydrogenation reactions} 

A catalyst such as platinum is normally needed for these reactions

$\rm{H_{2}C=CH_{2} + H_{2} \rightarrow H_{3}C-CH_{3}}$ (figure \ref{fig:organic:hydrogenation})

In the alkynes, there is at least one triple bond between two of the carbon atoms. They are unsaturated compounds and are therefore highly reactive. Their general formula is C$_{n}$H$_{2n-2}$. The simplest alkyne is ethyne (figure \ref{fig:om:ethyne}), also known as acetylene. Many of the alkynes are used to synthesise other chemical products.
\begin{IFact}{
The raw materials that are needed to make acetylene are calcium carbonate and coal.
% Acetylene can be produced through the following reactions:
% 
% $\text{CaCO}_{3} \rightarrow \text{CaO}$
% 
% $\text{CaO} + 3\text{C} \rightarrow \text{CaC}_{2} + \text{CO}$
% 
% $\text{CaC}_{2} + 2\text{H}_{2}\text{O} \rightarrow \text{Ca(OH)}_{2} + \text{C}_{2}\text{H}_{2}$

An important use of acetylene is in oxyacetylene gas welding. The fuel gas burns with oxygen in a torch. An incredibly high heat is produced, and this is hot enough to melt metal.

%\begin{IFact}{
\IFact{
Ethanol is a diuretic. In humans, ethanol reduces the secretion of a hormone called antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The role of ADH is to control the amount of water that the body retains. When this hormone is not secreted in the right quantities, it can cause dehydration because too much water is lost from the body in the urine. This is why people who drink too much alcohol can become dehydrated, and experience symptoms such as headaches, dry mouth, and lethargy. Part of the reason for the headaches is that dehydration causes the brain to shrink away from the skull slightly. The effects of drinking too much alcohol can be reduced by drinking lots of water.}

\subsection{Physical and chemical properties of the alcohols}
\label{sec:om:physchem}

The hydroxyl group affects the \textbf{solubility} of the alcohols. The hydroxyl group generally makes the alcohol molecule \textit{polar} and therefore more likely to be \textbf{soluble} in water. However, the carbon chain resists solubility, so there are two opposing trends in the alcohols. Alcohols with shorter carbon chains are usually more soluble than those with longer carbon chains.\\

Alcohols tend to have higher \textbf{boiling points} than the hydrocarbons because of the strong hydrogen bond between hydrogen atoms of one molecule and the oxygen atom of another molecule. \\

Alcohols can show either \textbf{acidic} or \textbf{basic} properties because of the hydroxyl group. They also undergo oxidation reactions to form aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids.


\Activity{Case Study}{The uses of the alcohols}{Read the extract below and then answer the questions that follow:\\

The alcohols are a very important group of organic compounds, and they have a variety of uses. Our most common use of the word 'alcohol' is with reference to alcoholic drinks. The alcohol in drinks is in fact \textbf{ethanol}. But ethanol has many more uses apart from alcoholic drinks! When ethanol burns in air, it produces carbon dioxide, water and energy and can therefore be used as a fuel on its own, or in mixtures with petrol. Because ethanol can be produced through fermentation, this is a useful way for countries without an oil industry to reduce imports of petrol. Ethanol is also used as a solvent in many perfumes and cosmetics.\\

\textbf{Methanol} can also be used as a fuel, or as a petrol additive to improve combustion. Most methanol is used as an industrial feedstock, in other words it is used to make other things such as methanal (formaldehyde), ethanoic acid and methyl esters. In most cases, these are then turned into other products.\\

\textbf{Propan-2-ol} is another important alcohol, which is used in a variety of applications as a solvent.\\

\textbf{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Give the structural formula for propan-2-ol.}
\item{Write a balanced chemical equation for the combustion reaction of ethanol.}
\item{Explain why the alcohols are good solvents.}

\section{Carboxylic Acids}
\label{sec:om:carboxylic}

Carboxylic acids are organic acids that are characterised by having a carboxyl group, which has the formula -(C=O)-OH, or more commonly written as -COOH. In a carboxyl group, an oxygen atom is double-bonded to a carbon atom, which is also bonded to a hydroxyl group. The simplest carboxylic acid, methanoic acid, is shown in figure \ref{fig:om:methanoic acid}. The IUPAC suffix for carboxylic acids is -anoic acid.

Carboxylic acids are widespread in nature. Methanoic acid (also known as \textit{formic acid}) has the formula HCOOH and is found in insect stings. Ethanoic acid (CH$_{3}$COOH), or \textit{acetic acid}, is the main component of vinegar. More complex organic acids also have a variety of different functions. Benzoic acid (C$_{6}$H$_{5}$COOH) for example, is used as a food preservative.

\begin{IFact}{
A certain type of ant, called formicine ants, manufacture and secrete formic acid, which is used to defend themselves against other organisms that might try to eat them.}
\end{IFact}

\subsection{Physical Properties}
\label{sec:om:physicalproperties}

Carboxylic acids are \textbf{weak acids}, in other words they only dissociate partially. Why does the carboxyl group have acidic properties? In the carboxyl group, the hydrogen tends to separate itself from the oxygen atom. In other words, the carboxyl group becomes a source of positively-charged hydrogen ions (H$^{+}$). This is shown in figure \ref{fig:om:dissociation carboxylic acid}.

\subsection{Derivatives of carboxylic acids: The esters}

When an alcohol reacts with a carboxylic acid, an \textbf{ester} is formed. Most esters have a characteristic smell. In the reaction, the hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group, and an OH from the carboxlic acid, form a molecule of water. A new bond is formed between what remains of the alcohol and acid. The name of the ester is a combination of the names of the alcohol and carboxylic acid. The suffix for an ester is -oate. An example is shown in figure \ref{fig:om:ester}.

\section{The Carbonyl Group}
\label{sec:om:carbonyl}

The carbonyl group (-CO) consists of a carbon atom that is joined to an oxygen by a double bond. If the functional group is on the \textit{end} of the carbon chain, the organic compound is called a \textbf{ketone}. The simplest ketone is \textit{acetone}, which contains three carbon atoms. A ketone has the suffix --one in its IUPAC name.

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Organic chemistry} is the branch of chemistry that deals with organic molecules. An \textbf{organic molecule} is one that contains carbon.}
\item{All \textbf{living organisms} contain carbon. Plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide in the air into organic compounds through the process of \textbf{photosynthesis}. Animals and other organisms then feed on plants to obtain their own organic compounds. \textbf{Fossil fuels} are another important source of carbon.}
\item{It is the \textbf{unique properties of the carbon atom} that give organic compounds certain properties.}
\item{The carbon atom has \textbf{four valence electrons}, so it can bond with many other atoms, often resulting in long chain structures. It also forms mostly \textbf{covalent bonds} with the atoms that it bonds to, meaning that most organic molecules are \textbf{non-polar}.}
\item{An organic compound can be represented in different ways, using its \textbf{molecular formula}, \textbf{structural formula} or \textbf{condensed structural formula}.}
\item{If two compounds are \textbf{isomers}, it means that they have the same molecular formulae but different structural formulae.}
\item{A \textbf{functional group} is a particular group of atoms within a molecule, which give it certain reaction characteristics. Organic compounds can be grouped according to their functional group.}
\item{The \textbf{hydrocarbons} are organic compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen. They can be further divided into the alkanes, alkenes and alkynes, based on the type of bonds between the carbon atoms.}
\item{The \textbf{alkanes} have only \textbf{single bonds} between their carbon atoms and are unreactive.}
\item{The \textbf{alkenes} have at least one \textbf{double bond} between two of their carbon atoms. They are more reactive than the alkanes.}
\item{The \textbf{alkynes} have at least one \textbf{triple bond} between two of their carbon atoms. They are the most reactive of the three groups.}
\item{A hydrocarbon is said to be \textbf{saturated} if it contains the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms for that molecule. The alkanes are all saturated compounds.}
\item{A hydrocarbon is \textbf{unsaturated} if it does not contain the maximum number of hydrogen atoms for that molecule. The alkenes and alkynes are examples of unsaturated molecules. If a double or triple bond is broken, more hydrogen atoms can be added to the molecule.}
\item{There are three types of reactions that occur in the alkanes: \textbf{substitution}, \textbf{elimination} and \textbf{oxidation} reactions.}
\item{The alkenes undergo \textbf{addition} reactions because they are unsaturated.}
\item{Organic compounds are \textbf{named} according to their functional group and its position in the molecule, the number of carbon atoms in the molecule and the position of any double and triple bonds. The IUPAC rules for nomenclature are used in the naming of organic molecules.}
\item{Many of the \textbf{properties} of the hydrocarbons are determined by their \textbf{molecular structure}, the \textbf{bonds} between atoms and molecules, and their \textbf{surface area}.}
\item{The \textbf{melting point} and \textbf{boiling point} of the hydrocarbons increases as their number of carbon atoms increases.}
\item{The \textbf{molecular mass} of the hydrocarbons determines whether they will be in the gaseous, liquid or solid phase at certain temperatures.}
\item{An \textbf{alcohol} is an organic compound that contains a \textbf{hydroxyl group} (-OH).}
\item{The alcohols have a number of different uses including their use as a solvent, for medicinal purposes and in alcoholic drinks.}
\item{The alcohols share a number of \textbf{properties} because of the hydroxyl group. The hydroxyl group affects the \textbf{solubility} of the alcohols. Those with shorter carbon chains are generally more soluble, and those with longer chains are less soluble. The strong hydrogen bond between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the hydroxyl group gives alcohols a higher melting point and boiling point than other organic compounds. The hydroxyl group also gives the alcohols both acidic and basic properties.}
\item{The \textbf{carboxylic acids} are organic acids that contain a \textbf{carboxyl group} with the formula -COOH. In a carboxyl group, an oxygen atom is double-bonded to a carbon atom, which is also bonded to a hydroxyl group.}
\item{The carboxylic acids have weak \textbf{acidic properties} because the hydrogen atom is able to dissociate from the carboxyl group.}
\item{An \textbf{ester} is formed when an alcohol reacts with a carboxylic acid.}
\item{The \textbf{amines} are organic compounds that contain an \textbf{amino} functional group, which has the formula -NH$_{2}$. Some amines belong to the \textbf{amino acid} group, which are the building blocks of proteins.}
\item{The \textbf{ketones} are a group of compounds that contain a \textbf{carbonyl group}, which consists of an oxygen atom that is double-bonded to a carbon atom. In a ketone, the carbonyl group is on the end of the carbon chain.}
