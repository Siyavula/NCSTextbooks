\label{p:wsl:s11}


\section{Introduction}
Now that we have studied the basics of longitudinal waves, we are ready to study sound waves in detail.

Have you ever thought about how amazing your sense of hearing is? It is actually pretty remarkable. There are many types of sounds: a car horn, a laughing baby, a barking dog, and somehow your brain can sort it all out. Though it seems complicated, it is rather simple to understand once you learn a very simple fact. Sound is a wave. So you can use everything you know about waves to explain sound.

Since sound is a wave, we can relate the properties of sound to the properties of a wave. The basic properties of sound are: pitch, loudness and tone.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Pitch}
The frequency of a sound wave is what your ear understands as pitch. A higher frequency sound has a higher pitch, and a lower frequency sound has a lower pitch. In Figure~\ref{fig:pitchetc} sound A has a higher pitch than sound B. For instance, the chirp of a bird would have a high pitch, but the roar of a lion would have a low pitch.

The human ear can detect a wide range of frequencies. Frequencies from 20 to 20 000 Hz are audible to the human ear. Any sound with a frequency below 20 Hz is known as an \textbf{infrasound} and any sound with a frequency above 20 000 Hz is known as an \textbf{ultrasound}.

Table~\ref{p:wsl:s11:rangeoff} lists the ranges of some common animals compared to humans.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\Activity{Investigation}{Range of Wavelengths}{Using the information given in Table~\ref{p:wsl:s11:rangeoff}, calculate the lower and upper wavelengths that each species can hear. Assume the speed of sound in air is 344~\ms.}

\subsection{Loudness}
The amplitude of a sound wave determines its loudness or volume. A larger amplitude means a louder sound, and a smaller amplitude means a softer sound. In Figure~\ref{fig:pitchetc} sound C is louder than sound B. The vibration of a source sets the amplitude of a wave. It transmits energy into the medium through its vibration. More energetic vibration corresponds to larger amplitude. The molecules move back and forth more vigorously.

The loudness of a sound is also determined by the sensitivity of the ear. The human ear is more sensitive to some frequencies than to others. The volume we receive thus depends on both the amplitude of a sound wave and whether its frequency lies in a region where the ear is more or less sensitive.

\subsection{Tone}
Tone is a measure of the quality of the sound wave. For example, the quality of the sound produced in a particular musical instruments depends on which
harmonics are superposed and in which proportions. The harmonics are determined by the standing waves that are produced in the instrument. Chapter~\ref{p:wsl:pm11} will explain the physics of music in greater detail.

The quality (timbre) of the sound heard depends on the pattern of the incoming vibrations, i.e. the \textit{shape} of the sound wave. The more irregular the vibrations, the more jagged is the shape of the sound wave and the harsher is the sound heard.

\section{Speed of Sound}
The speed of sound depends on the medium the sound is travelling in. Sound travels faster in solids than in liquids, and faster in liquids than in gases. This is because the density of solids is higher than that of liquids which means that the particles are closer together. Sound can be transmitted more easily.

The speed of sound also depends on the temperature of the medium. The hotter the medium is, the faster its particles move and therefore the quicker the sound will travel through the medium. When we heat a substance, the particles in that substance have more kinetic energy and vibrate or move faster. Sound can therefore be transmitted more easily and quickly in hotter substances.

Sound waves are pressure waves. The speed of sound will therefore be influenced by the pressure of the medium through which it is travelling. At sea level the air pressure is higher than high up on a mountain. Sound will travel faster at sea level where the air pressure is higher than it would at places high above sea level.

\Definition{Speed of sound}{The speed of sound in air, at sea level, at a temperature of 21\deg C and under normal atmospheric conditions, is 344~\ms.}

\section{Physics of the Ear and Hearing}
%\begin{syllabus}

\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Diagram of the human ear. }
\label{Human Ear}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

The human ear is divided into three main sections: the outer, middle,
and inner ear. Let's follow the journey of a sound wave from the pinna (outermost part) to the auditory nerve (innermost part) which transmits a signal to the brain. The pinna  is the part of the ear we typically think of when we refer to the ear. Its main
function is to collect and focus an incident sound wave. The wave
then travels through the ear canal until it meets the eardrum. The
pressure fluctuations of the sound wave make the eardrum vibrate.
The three very small bones of the middle ear, the malleus (hammer),
the incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup), transmit the signal through
to the elliptical window. The elliptical window is the beginning of the
inner ear. From the elliptical window the sound waves are transmitted through the liquid
in the inner ear and interpreted as sounds by the brain.
The inner ear, made of the semicircular canals, the cochlea,
and the auditory nerve, is filled with fluid. The fluid allows the body to
detect quick movements and maintain balance. The snail-shaped cochlea
is covered in nerve cells. There are more than 25 000 hairlike
nerve cells. Different nerve cells vibrate with different
frequencies. When a nerve cell vibrates, it releases electrical impulses
to the auditory nerve. The impulses are sent to the brain through the
auditory nerve and understood as sound.

\subsection{Intensity of Sound}
Intensity is one indicator of amplitude. Intensity is the energy transmitted over a unit of area each second.

\Extension{Intensity}{Intensity is defined as:
\nequ{\rm{Intensity}=\frac{\rm{energy}}{\rm{time} \times \rm{area}}=\frac{\rm{power}}{\rm{area}}}

By the definition of intensity, we can see that the units of intensity are
\nequ{\frac{\rm{Joules}}{\mathrm{s \cdot m^{2}}}=\frac{\rm{Watts}}{\rm{m}^{2}}}
}

The unit of intensity is the \textbf{decibel} (symbol: dB). This reduces to an SI equivalent of $\mathrm{W \cdot m^{-2}}$.

The average threshold of hearing is $10^{-12}~\mathrm{W\cdot m^{-2}}$. Below this intensity, the sound is too soft for the ear to hear. The threshold of pain is $1.0~\mathrm{W\cdot m^{-2}}$. Above this intensity a sound is so loud it becomes uncomfortable for
the ear.

Notice that there is a factor of $10^{12}$ between the thresholds of
hearing and pain. This is one reason we define the decibel (dB) scale.

\Extension{dB Scale}{The intensity in dB of a sound of intensity $I$, is given by:
\begin{equation}
\beta =10~\log\frac{I}{I_o} \qquad \qquad {I_o}=10^{-12}~\mathrm{W\cdot m^{-2}}
\end{equation}}

In this way we can compress the whole hearing intensity scale into a
range from 0 dB to 120 dB.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
\caption{Examples of sound intensities.}
\label{p:wsl:s11:intensity}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\hline
\textbf{Source}&\textbf{Intensity} (dB) & \textbf{Times greater than hearing threshold}\\\hline
& & \\
Rocket Launch &180 & $10^{18}$\\
Jet Plane & 140 & $10^{14}$ \\
Threshold of Pain & 120 & $10^{12}$\\
Rock Band & 110 & $10^{11}$\\
Subway Train & 90 & $10^{9}$\\
Factory & 80 & $10^{8}$\\
City Traffic & 70 & $10^{7}$\\
Normal Conversation & 60 & $10^{6}$\\
Library & 40 & $10^{4}$\\
Whisper & 20 & $10^{2}$\\
Threshold of hearing & 0 & 0\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Notice that there are sounds which exceed the threshold
of pain. Exposure to these sounds can cause immediate damage to hearing.
In fact, exposure to sounds from
80 dB and above can damage hearing over time. Measures
can be taken to avoid damage, such as wearing earplugs
or ear muffs. Limiting exposure time and
increasing distance between you and the source are also
important steps for protecting your hearing.

\Activity{Discussion}{Importance of Safety Equipment}{Working in groups of 5, discuss the importance of safety equipment such as ear protectors for workers in loud environments, e.g. those who use jack hammers or direct aeroplanes to their parking bays. Write up your conclusions in a one page report. Some prior research into the importance of safety equipment might be necessary to complete this group discussion.}

\section{Ultrasound}
%\begin{syllabus}
%\item The learner must be able to describe sound with frequencies higher than 20 kHz as ultrasound, up to about 100 kHz.
%\item The learner must be able to explain how an image can be created using ultrasound based on the fact that when a wave encounters a boundary between two media, part of the wave is reflected and part is transmitted.
%\item The learner must be able to describe some of the medical benefits and uses of ultrasound, e.g. safety, diagnosis, treatment, pregnancy.
%\item Notes: Make a link to Grade 10, reflection and transmission at a boundary. When an ultrasound wave travels inside an object comprising different materials such as the human body, each time it encounters a boundary, e.g. between bone and muscle, or muscle and fat, part of the wave is reflected and part of it is transmitted. The reflected rays are detected and used to construct an image of the object.
%\end{syllabus}

Ultrasound is sound with a frequency that is higher than 20 kHz. Some animals, such as dogs, dolphins, and bats, have an upper limit that is greater than that of the human ear and can hear ultrasound.

The most common use of ultrasound is to create images, and has industrial and medical applications. The use of ultrasound to create images is based on the reflection and transmission of a wave at a boundary. When an ultrasound wave travels inside an object that is made up of different materials such as the human body, each time it encounters a boundary, e.g. between bone and muscle, or muscle and fat, part of the wave is reflected and part of it is transmitted. The reflected rays are detected and used to construct an image of the object.

Ultrasound in medicine can visualise muscle and soft tissue, making them useful for scanning the organs, and is commonly used during pregnancy. Ultrasound is a safe, non-invasive method of looking inside the human body.

Ultrasound sources may be used to generate local heating in biological tissue, with applications in physical therapy and cancer treatment. Focused ultrasound sources may be used to break up kidney stones.

Ultrasonic cleaners, sometimes called supersonic cleaners, are used at frequencies from 20-40 kHz for jewellery, lenses and other optical parts, watches, dental instruments, surgical instruments and industrial parts.
These cleaners consist of containers with a fluid in which the object to be cleaned is placed. Ultrasonic waves are then sent into the fluid. The main mechanism for cleaning action in an ultrasonic cleaner is actually the energy released from the collapse of millions of microscopic bubbles occurring in the liquid of the cleaner.

\begin{IFact}{Ultrasound generator/speaker systems are sold with claims that they frighten away rodents and insects, but there is no scientific evidence that the devices work; controlled tests have shown that rodents quickly learn that the speakers are harmless.
}\end{IFact}

%\begin{IFact}
%{Medical ultrasonography was invented in 1953 at Lund University in Sweden by cardiologist Inge Edler and Carl Hellmuth %Hertz, the son of Gustav Ludwig Hertz, who was a graduate student at the department for nuclear physics.}
%\end{IFact}

%\begin{IFact}{In echo-sounding the reflections from ultrasound pulses that are bounced off objects (for example the bottom of the sea, fish etc.) are picked up. The reflections are timed and since their speed is known, the distance to the object can be found. This information can be built into a picture of the object that reflects the ultrasound pulses.}
%\end{IFact}

%In medical scanning, the ultrasound is reflected off each tissue boundary and is picked up. %The reflections are used to build up a picture showing what is inside the body, for example %in pre-natal scans. Some of the ultrasound energy is absorbed by the body, but it is much %less damaging than x-rays.

Ships on the ocean make use of the reflecting properties of sound waves to determine the depth of the ocean. A sound wave is transmitted and bounces off the seabed. Because the speed of sound is known and the time lapse between sending and receiving the sound can be measured, the distance from the ship to the bottom of the ocean can be determined, This is called sonar, which stands from \textbf{So}und \textbf{N}avigation \textbf{A}nd \textbf{R}anging.

\subsection{Echolocation}
Animals like dolphins and bats make use of sounds waves to find their way. Just like ships on the ocean, bats use sonar to navigate. Ultrasound waves that are sent out are reflected off the objects around the animal. Bats, or dolphins, then use the reflected sounds to form a ``picture'' of their surroundings. This is called echolocation.

\begin{wex}{SONAR}
{A ship sends a signal to the bottom of the ocean to determine the depth of the ocean. The speed of sound in sea water is 1450 $\rm{m.s^{-1}}$ If the signal is received 1,5 seconds later, how deep is the ocean at that point?}

\item{How is intensity related to loudness?}
\item Person 1 speaks to person 2. Explain how the sound is created by person 1 and how it is possible for person 2 to hear the conversation.
\item{Sound cannot travel in space. Discuss what other modes of communication astronauts can use when they are outside the space shuttle?}
\item{An automatic focus camera uses an ultrasonic sound wave to focus on objects. The camera sends out sound waves which are reflected off distant objects and return to the camera. A sensor detects the time it takes for the waves to return and then determines the distance an object is from the camera. If a sound wave (speed = 344~\ms) returns to the camera 0,150~s after leaving the camera, how far away is the object?}
\item{Calculate the frequency (in Hz) and wavelength of the annoying sound made by a mosquito when it beats its wings at the average rate of 600 wing beats per second. Assume the speed of the sound waves is 344~\ms.}
\item{How does halving the frequency of a wave source affect the speed of the waves?}
\item{Humans can detect frequencies as high as 20~000 Hz. Assuming the speed of sound in air is 344~\ms, calculate the wavelength of the sound corresponding to the upper range of audible hearing.}
\item{An elephant trumpets at 10~Hz. Assuming the speed of sound in air is 344~\ms, calculate the wavelength of this infrasonic sound wave made by the elephant.}

\item A ship sends a signal out to determine the depth of the ocean. The signal returns 2,5 seconds later. If sound travels at
1450 m.s$^{-1}$ in sea water, how deep is the ocean at that point?
