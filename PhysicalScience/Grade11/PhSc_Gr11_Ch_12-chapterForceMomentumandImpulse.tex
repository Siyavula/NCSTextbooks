\chapter{Force, Momentum and Impulse}
\label{p:m:fmi11}



\section{Introduction}
In Grade 10 we studied motion but not what caused the motion. In this chapter we will learn that a net force is needed to cause motion. We recall what a force is and learn about how force and motion are related. We are introduced to two new concepts, momentum and impulse, and we learn more about turning forces and the force of gravity.

\section{Force}
%\nts{This section could do with more activities, notably some simple experiments.}

\subsection{What is a \textit{force}?}
A force is anything that can cause a change to objects. Forces can:
\begin{itemize}
\item change the shape of an object
\item accelerate or stop an object
\item change the direction of a moving object.
\end{itemize}

A force can be classified as either a \textit{contact force} or a \textit{non-contact force}.

A contact force must touch or \textit{be in contact} with an object to cause a change. Examples of contact forces are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the force that is used to push or pull things, like on a door to open or close it
\item the force that a sculptor uses to turn clay into a pot
\item the force of the wind to turn a windmill
\end{itemize}

%\Activity{Contact Forces}{Write down 5 examples (excluding those given above) of contact forces that you see on your way to school.}

A non-contact force does not have to touch an object to cause a change. Examples of non-contact forces are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the force due to gravity, like the Earth pulling the Moon towards itself
\item the force due to electricity, like a proton and an electron attracting each other
\item the force due to magnetism, like a magnet pulling a paper clip towards itself
\end{itemize}

The unit of force is the \emph{newton} (symbol \emph{N}). This unit is named after Sir Isaac Newton who first defined force. Force is a vector quantity and has a magnitude and a direction. We use the abbreviation \emph{F} for force.

\begin{IFact}{There is a popular story that while Sir Isaac Newton was sitting under an apple tree, an apple fell on his head, and he suddenly thought of the Universal Law of Gravitation. Coincidently, the weight of a small apple is approximately 1~N.}\end{IFact}

\begin{IFact}{Force was first described by Archimedes of Syracuse (circa 287 BC - 212 BC). Archimedes was a Greek mathematician, astronomer, philosopher, physicist and engineer. He was killed by a Roman soldier during the sack of the city, despite orders from the Roman general, Marcellus, that he was not to be harmed.}
\end{IFact}

This chapter will often refer to the \emph{resultant force} acting on an object. The resultant force is simply the vector sum of all the forces acting on the object. It is very important to remember that all the forces must be acting on the \emph{same} object. The resultant force is the force that has the same effect as all the other forces added together.

\subsection{Examples of Forces in Physics}
Most of Physics revolves around the study of forces. Although there are many different forces, all are handled in the same way. All forces in Physics can be put into one of four groups. These are gravitational forces, electromagnetic forces, strong nuclear forces and weak nuclear forces. You will mostly come across gravitational or electromagnetic forces at school.

\subsubsection{Gravitational Forces}
Gravity is the attractive force between two objects due to the mass of the objects. When you throw a ball in the air, its mass and the Earth's mass attract each other, which leads to a force between them. The ball falls back towards the Earth, and the Earth accelerates towards the ball. The movement of the Earth towards the ball is, however, so small that you couldn't possibly measure it.

\subsubsection{Electromagnetic Forces}
Almost all of the forces that we experience in everyday life are
electromagnetic in origin. They have this unusual name because long ago people thought that electric forces and magnetic forces were different things. After much work and experimentation, it has been realised that they are actually different manifestations of the same underlying theory.

\subsubsection{Electric or Electrostatic Forces}
If we have objects carrying electrical charge, which are not moving, then we are dealing with electrostatic forces (Coulomb's Law). This force is actually much stronger than gravity. This may seem strange, since gravity is obviously very powerful, and holding a balloon to the wall seems to be the most impressive thing electrostatic forces have done, but if we think about it: for gravity to be detectable, we need to have a very large mass nearby. But a balloon rubbed against someone's hair can stick to a wall with a force so strong that it overcomes the force of gravity between the entire Earth and the balloon---with just the charges in the balloon and the wall!

\subsubsection{Magnetic Forces}
The magnetic force is a different manifestation of the electromagnetic force. It stems from the interaction between \emph{moving charges} as opposed to the \emph{fixed} charges involved in Coulomb's Law. Examples of the magnetic force in action include magnets, compasses, car engines and computer data storage. Magnets are also used in the wrecking industry to pick up cars and move them around sites.

\subsubsection{Friction}
According to Newton's First Law (we will discuss this later in the chapter) an object moving \emph{without a force acting on it} will keep on moving. Then why does a box sliding on a table come to a stop? The answer is friction. Friction arises where two surfaces are in contact and moving relative to eachother as a result of the interaction between the molecules of the two contact surfaces---for instance the interactions between the molecules on the bottom of the box with molecules on the top of the table. This interaction is electromagnetic in origin, hence friction is just another view of the electromagnetic force. Later in this chapter we will discuss frictional forces a little more.

\subsubsection{Drag Forces}
This is the force an object experiences while travelling through a medium like an aeroplane flying through air. When something travels through the air it needs to displace air as it travels and because of this, the air exerts a force on the object. This becomes an important force when you move fast and a lot of thought is taken to try and reduce the amount of drag force a sports car or an aeroplane experiences. The drag force is very useful for parachutists. They jump from high altitudes and if there was no drag force, then they would continue accelerating all the way to the ground. Parachutes are wide because the more surface area you have, the greater the drag force and hence the slower you hit the ground.

\subsection{Systems and External Forces}
The concepts of systems and forces external to such systems are very important in Physics. A system is any collection of objects. If one draws an imaginary box around such a system then an external force is one that
is applied by an object or person outside the box. Imagine for example a car pulling two trailers.

If we draw a box around the two trailers they can be considered a closed system or unit. When we look at the forces on this closed system the following forces will apply (we assume drag forces are absent):
\begin{itemize}
\item The force of the car pulling the unit (trailer A and B)
\item The force of friction between the wheels of the trailers and the road (opposite to the direction of motion)
\item The force of the Earth pulling downwards on the system (gravity)
\item The force of the road pushing upwards on the system
\end{itemize}

These forces are called external forces to the system.\\
The following forces will not apply:
\begin{itemize}
\item The force of A pulling B
\item The force of B pulling A
\item The force of friction between the wheels of the car and the road (opposite to the direction of motion)
\end{itemize}

We can also draw a box around trailer A or B, in which case the forces will be different.

If we consider trailer A as a system, the following external forces will apply:
\begin{itemize}
\item The force of the car pulling on A (towards the right)
\item The force of B pulling on A (towards the left)
\item The force of the Earth pulling downwards on the trailer (gravity)
\item The force of the road pushing upwards on the trailer
\item The force of friction between the wheels of A and the road (opposite to the direction of motion)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Force Diagrams}
If we look at the example above and draw a force diagram of all the forces acting on the two-trailer-unit, the diagram would look like this:

It is important to keep the following in mind when you draw force diagrams:
\begin{itemize}
\item Make your drawing large and clear.
\item You must use arrows and the direction of the arrow will show the direction of the force.
\item The length of the arrow will indicate the size of the force, in other words, the longer arrows in the diagram (F$_1$ for example) indicates a bigger force than a shorter arrow (F$_f$). Arrows of the same length indicate forces of equal size (F$_N$ and F$_g$). Use ``little lines'' like in maths to show this.
\item Draw neat lines using a ruler. The arrows must touch the system or object.
\item All arrows must have labels. Use letters with a key on the side if you do not have enough space on your drawing.
\item The labels must indicate what is applying the force (the force of the car?) on what the force is applied (?on the trailer?) and in which direction (to the right)
\item If the values of the forces are known, these values can be added to the diagram or key.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Free Body Diagrams}
In a free-body diagram, the object of interest is drawn as a dot and all the forces acting on it are drawn as arrows pointing away from the dot.
A free body diagram for the two-trailer-system will therefore look like this:\\

\subsection{Finding the Resultant Force}
The easiest way to determine a resultant force is to draw a free body diagram. Remember from Chapter \ref{chap:vectors} that we use the length of the arrow to indicate the vector's magnitude and the direction of the arrow to show which direction it acts in.

After we have done this, we have a diagram of vectors and we simply find the sum of the vectors to get the resultant force.

}
\end{pspicture}
\caption{(a) Force diagram of 2 forces acting on a box. (b) Free body diagram of the box.}
\label{forces:1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

For example, two people push on a box from opposite sides with forces of 4~N and 6~N respectively as shown in Figure~\ref{forces:1}(a). The free body diagram in Figure~\ref{forces:1}(b) shows the object represented by a dot and the two forces are represented by arrows with their tails on the dot.

As you can see, the arrows point in opposite directions and have different lengths. The resultant force is 2~N to the left. This result can be obtained algebraically too, since the two forces act along the same line. First, as in motion in one direction, choose a frame of reference. Secondly, add the two vectors taking their directions into account.

For the example, assume that the positive direction is to the right, then:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{R} &=& (+4\eN)+(-6\eN)\\
&=& -2\eN\\
&=& 2 \eN~ \mbox{to the left}
\end{eqnarray*}

Remember that a negative answer means that the force acts in the \emph{opposite} direction to the one that you chose to be positive. You can \emph{choose} the positive direction to be any way you want, but once you have chosen it you \emph{must} keep it.

As you work with more force diagrams in which the forces exactly balance, you may notice that you get a zero answer (e.g. 0~N). This simply means that the forces are balanced and that the object will not accelerate.

Once a force diagram has been drawn the techniques of vector addition introduced in Chapter~\ref{chap:vectors} can be used. Depending on the situation you might choose to use a graphical technique such as the tail-to-head method or the parallelogram method, or else an algebraic approach to determine the resultant. Since force is a vector quantity all of these methods apply.

\begin{wex}{Finding the resultant force}
{A car (mass 1200 kg) applies a force of 2000 N on a trailer (mass 250 kg). A constant frictional force of 200 N is acting on the trailer, and a constant frictional force of 300 N is acting on the car.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a force diagram of all the forces acting on the car.
\item Draw a free body diagram of all the horizontal forces acting on the trailer.
\item Use the force diagram to determine the resultant force on the trailer.
\end{enumerate}
}

\section{Newton's Laws}
In grade 10 you learned about motion, but did not look at how things start to move. You have also learned about forces. In this section we will look at the effect of forces on objects and how we can make things move.

\subsection{Newton's First Law}
Sir Isaac Newton was a scientist who lived in England (1642-1727) who was interested in the motion of objects under various conditions. He suggested that a stationary object will remain stationary unless a force acts on it and that a moving object will continue moving unless a force slows it down, speeds it up or changes its direction of motion. From this he formulated what is known as Newton's First Law of Motion:

\Definition{Newton's First Law of Motion}{An object will remain in a state of rest or continue traveling at constant velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced (net) force. }

Let us consider the following situations:\\

An ice skater pushes herself away from the side of the ice rink and skates across the ice. She will continue to move in a straight line across the ice unless something stops her. Objects are also like that. If we kick a soccer ball across a soccer field, according to Newton's First Law, the soccer ball should keep on moving forever! However, in real life this does not happen. Is Newton's Law wrong? Not really. Newton's First Law applies to situations where there aren't any external forces present. This means that friction is not present. In the case of the ice skater, the friction between the skates and the ice is very little and she will continue moving for quite a distance. In the case of the soccer ball, air resistance (friction between the air and the ball) and friction between the grass and the ball is present and this will slow the ball down.

\subsubsection{Newton's First Law in action}
We experience Newton's First Law in every day life. Let us look at the following examples:\\

{\bf{Rockets}}:\\

A spaceship is launched into space. The force of the exploding gases pushes the rocket through the air into space. Once it is in space, the engines are switched off and it will keep on moving at a constant velocity. If the astronauts want to change the direction of the spaceship they need to fire an engine. This will then apply a force on the rocket and it will change its direction.

{\bf{Seat belts}:}\\

We wear seat belts in cars. This is to protect us when the car is involved in an accident. If a car is traveling at 120 \kph, the passengers in the car is also traveling at 120 \kph. When the car suddenly stops a force is exerted on the car (making it slow down), but not on the passengers. The passengers will carry on moving forward at 120 \kph according to Newton I. If they are wearing seat belts, the seat belts will stop them by exerting a force on them and so prevent them from getting hurt.

\begin{wex}{Newton's First Law in action}{Why do passengers get thrown to the side when the car they are driving in goes around a corner?}
{\westep{What happens before the car turns}
Before the car starts turning both the passengers and the car are traveling at the same velocity. (picture A)

\westep{What happens while the car turns}
The driver turns the wheels of the car, which then exert a force on the car and the car turns. This force acts on the car but not the passengers, hence (by Newton's First Law) the passengers continue moving with the same original velocity. (picture B)

\westep{Why passengers get thrown to the side?}
If the passengers are wearing seat belts they will exert a force on the passengers until the passengers' velocity is the same as that of the car (picture C). Without a seat belt the passenger may hit the side of the car.

\subsection{Newton's Second Law of Motion}
According to Newton I, things 'like to keep on doing what they are doing'. In other words, if an object is moving, it tends to continue moving (in a straight line and at the same speed) and if an object is stationary, it tends to remain stationary. So how do objects start moving?

Let us look at the example of a 10 kg box on a rough table. If we push lightly on the box as indicated in the diagram, the box won't move. Let's say we applied a force of 100 N, yet the box remains stationary. At this point a frictional force of 100 N is acting on the box, preventing the box from moving. If we increase the force, let's say to 150 N and the box almost starts to move, the frictional force is 150 N. To be able to move the box, we need to push hard enough to overcome the friction and then move the box. If we therefore apply a force of 200 N remembering that a frictional force of 150 N is present, the 'first' 150 N will be used to overcome or 'cancel' the friction and the other 50 N will be used to move (accelerate) the block. In order to accelerate an object we must have a resultant force acting on the block.

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-3,-1)(4,1)

\uput[ur](-3,0){rough table}
\uput[r](1.5,0.5){applied force}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

Now, what do you think will happen if we pushed harder, lets say 300 N? Or, what do you think will happen if the mass of the block was more, say 20 kg, or what if it was less? Let us investigate how the motion of an object is affected by mass and force.

\begin{enumerate}
\item A constant force of 20 N, acting at an angle of 60$\degree$ to the horizontal, is applied to a dynamics trolley.
\item Ticker tape attached to the trolley runs through a ticker timer of frequency 20 Hz as the trolley is moving on the frictionless surface.
\item The above procedure is repeated 4 times, each time using the same force, but varying the mass of the trolley as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Case 1: 6,25~kg
\item Case 2: 3,57~kg
\item Case 3: 2,27~kg
\item Case 4: 1,67~kg
\end{itemize}
\item Shown below are sections of the four ticker tapes obtained. The tapes are marked with the letters A, B, C, D, etc. A is the first dot, B is the second dot and so on. The distance between each dot is also shown.

Instructions:\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use each tape to calculate the instantaneous velocity (in \ms) of the trolley at points B and F (remember to convert the distances to m first!). Use these velocities to calculate the trolley's acceleration in each case.
%\item Use Newton's second law to calculate the mass of the trolley in each case.
\item Tabulate the mass and corresponding acceleration values as calculated in each case. Ensure that each column and row in your table is appropriately labeled.
\item Draw a graph of acceleration vs. mass, using a scale of 1 cm = 1 \mss on the y-axis and 1 cm = 1 kg on the x-axis.
\item Use your graph to read off the acceleration of the trolley if its mass is 5 kg.
\item Write down a conclusion for the experiment.
\end{enumerate}
}

You will have noted in the investigation above that the heavier the trolley is, the slower it moved. The acceleration is \textit{inversely} proportional to the mass. In mathematical terms:
\begin{equation*}
a \propto frac{1}{m}
\end{equation*}

In a similar investigation where the mass is kept constant, but the applied force is varied, you will find that the bigger the force is, the faster the object will move. The acceleration of the trolley is therefore \textit{directly} proportional to the resultant force. In mathematical terms:
\begin{equation*}
a \propto F.
\end{equation*}

Rearranging the above equations, we get $a$ $\propto$ $\frac{F}{m}$ OR $F~=~ma$\\

Newton formulated his second law as follows:\\

\Definition{Newton's Second Law of Motion}{
If a resultant force acts on a body, it will cause the body to accelerate in the direction of the resultant force. The acceleration of the body will be directly proportional to the resultant force and inversely proportional to the mass of the body. The mathematical representation is:
\begin{equation*}
F = ma.
\end{equation*}

\westep{Calculate the frictional force}
To find the frictional force we will apply Newton's Second Law. We are given the mass (10 + 15 kg) and the acceleration (2 \mss). Choose the direction of motion to be the positive direction (to the right is positive).
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{R} = ma\\
F_{\rm{applied}}+ F_{f} = ma\\
500 + F_{f} = (10 + 15) (2)\\
F_{f} = 50 - 500\\
F_{f} = - 450 N\\
\end{eqnarray*}
The frictional force is 450 N opposite to the direction of motion (to the left).\\

\westep{Find the tension in the rope}
To find the tension in the rope we need to look at one of the two crates on their own. Let's choose the 10 kg crate. Firstly, we need to draw a force diagram:

\end{pspicture}
}
\end{center}
\caption{Force diagram of 10 kg crate}
\end{figure}

The frictional force on the 10 kg block is one third of the total, therefore:\\
$F_{f} = \frac{1}{3} \times$ 450\\
$F_{f} = 150\ \rm{N}$\\

If we apply Newton's Second Law:\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{R} &=& ma\\
T + F_{f} &=& (10)(2)\\
T + (-150) &=& 20\\
T &=& 170\ \rm{N}
\end{eqnarray*}

Note: If we had used the same principle and applied it to 15 kg crate, our calculations would have been the following:\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{R} &=& ma\\
F_{\rm{applied}}+T + F_{f} &=& (15)(2)\\
500 + T + (-300) &=& 30\\
T &=& -170\ \rm{N}
\end{eqnarray*}
The negative answer here means that the force is in the direction opposite to the motion, in other words to the left, which is correct. However, the question asks for the magnitude of the force and your answer will be quoted as 170 N.

\subsubsection{Object on an inclined plane}
When we place an object on a slope the force of gravity (F$_{g}$) acts straight down and not perpendicular to the slope. Due to gravity pulling straight down, the object will tend to slide down the slope with a force equal to the horizontal component of the force of gravity (F$_{g}$~sin~$\theta$). The object will 'stick' to the slope due to the frictional force between the object and the surface. As you increase the angle of the slope, the horizontal component will also increase until the frictional force is overcome and the object starts to slide down the slope.

The force of gravity will also tend to push an object 'into' the slope. The vertical component of this force is equal to the vertical component of the force of gravity (F$_{g}$ cos $\theta$). There is no movement in this direction as this force is balanced by the slope pushing up against the object. This ``pushing force'' is called the normal force (N) and is equal to the force required to make the component of the resultant force perpendicularly into the plane zero, F$_{g}$ cos $\theta$ in this case, but opposite in direction.

\Tip{Do not use the abbreviation W for weight as it is used to abbreviate 'work'. Rather use the force of gravity F$_{g}$ for weight.}

{\westep{Analyse the situation}
The question asks us to identify the frictional force. The body is said to be at rest on the plane, which means that it is not moving and therefore there is no resultant force. The frictional force must therefore be balanced by the force F up the inclined plane.
\westep{Choose the correct answer}
The frictional force is equal to the component of the weight (Mg) parallel to the surface, which is equal to Mg~sin~$\theta$.

{\westep{Find the magnitude of P}
We are usually asked to find the magnitude of T, but in this case T is given and we are asked to find P. We can use the same equation. T is the force that balances the component of P parallel to the plane (P$_x$) and therefore it has the same magnitude.\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
T &=& P~\rm{sin}~\theta\\
312 &=& P~\rm{sin}~35\degree\\
P &=& 544~\eN
\end{eqnarray*}
\westep{Find the magnitude of R}
R can also be determined with the use of trigonometric ratios. The tan or cos ratio can be used. We recommend that you use the tan ratio because it does not involve using the value for P (for in case you made a mistake in calculating P).
\begin{eqnarray*}
\rm{tan}~55\degree &=& \frac{R}{T}\\
\rm{tan}~55\degree &=& \frac{R}{312}\\
R &=& \rm{tan}~55\degree \times 312\\
R &=& 445,6~\eN\\
R &=& 446~\eN
\end{eqnarray*}
Note that the question asks that the answers be given to 3 significant figures. We therefore round 445,6 N up to 446 N.

\subsubsection{Lifts and rockets}
So far we have looked at objects being pulled or pushed across a surface, in other words motion parallel to the surface the object rests on. Here we only considered forces parallel to the surface, but we can also lift objects up or let them fall. This is vertical motion where only vertical forces are being considered.\\
\\
Let us consider a 500 kg lift, with no passengers, hanging on a cable. The purpose of the cable is to pull the lift upwards so that it can reach the next floor or to let go a little so that it can move downwards to the floor below. We will look at five possible stages during the motion of the lift.\\
%Drawing of lift with different stages

{\bf{Stage 1:}}\\ The 500 kg lift is stationary at the second floor of a tall building.\\
Because the lift is stationary (not moving) there is no resultant force acting on the lift. This means that the upward forces must be balanced by the downward forces. The only force acting down is the force of gravity which is equal to (500 x 9,8 = 4900 N) in this case. The cable must therefore pull upwards with a force of 4900 N to keep the lift stationary at this point.\\
\\
{\bf{Stage 2:}}\\ The lift moves upwards at an acceleration of 1 \mss.\\
If the lift is accelerating, it means that there is a resultant force in the direction of the motion. This means that the force acting upwards is now greater than the force of gravity F$_{g}$ (down). To find the magnitude of the force applied by the cable (F$_{c}$) we can do the following calculation: (Remember to choose a direction as positive. We have chosen upwards as positive.)\\

\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{R} &=& ma\\
F_{c}+ F_{g} &=& ma\\
F_{c}+ (-4900) &=& (500)(1)\\
F_{c} &=& 5400~\rm{N~upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

The answer makes sense as we need a bigger force upwards to cancel the effect of gravity as well as make the lift go faster.\\
\\
{\bf{Stage 3:}}\\ The lift moves at a constant velocity.\\
When the lift moves at a constant velocity, it means that all the forces are balanced and that there is no resultant force. The acceleration is zero, therefore F$_{R}$ = 0. The force acting upwards is equal to the force acting downwards, therefore F$_{c}$ = 4900 N.\\
\\
{\bf{Stage 4:}}\\ The lift slows down at a rate of 2\mss.\\
As the lift is now slowing down there is a resultant force downwards. This means that the force acting downwards is greater than the force acting upwards. To find the magnitude of the force applied by the cable (F$_{c}$) we can do the following calculation: Again we have chosen upwards as positive, which means that the acceleration will be a negative number.\\

\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{R} &=& ma\\
F_{c}+ F_{g} &=& ma\\
F_{c}+ (-4900) &=& (500)(-2)\\
F_{c} &=& 3900~\rm{N~upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

This makes sense as we need a smaller force upwards to ensure that the resultant force is downward. The force of gravity is now greater than the upward pull of the cable and the lift will slow down.\\
\\
{\bf{Stage 5:}}\\ The cable snaps.\\
When the cable snaps, the force that used to be acting upwards is no longer present. The only force that is present would be the force of gravity. The lift will freefall and its acceleration can be calculated as follows:

\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{R} &=& ma\\
F_{c}+ F_{g} &=& ma\\
0 + (-4900) &=& (500)(a)\\
a &=& -9,8 \emss\\
a &=& 9,8 \emss \rm{downwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsubsection{Rockets}
As with lifts, rockets are also examples of objects in vertical motion. The force of gravity pulls the rocket down while the thrust of the engine pushes the rocket upwards. The force that the engine exerts must overcome the force of gravity so that the rocket can accelerate upwards. The worked example below looks at the application of Newton's Second Law in launching a rocket.

\begin{wex}{Newton II - rocket}
{A rocket is launched vertically upwards into the sky at an acceleration of 20 \mss. If the mass of the rocket is 5000 kg, calculate the magnitude and direction of the thrust of the rocket's engines.
%picture of rocket
}
{\westep{Analyse what is given and what is asked}
We have the following:\\
m = 5000 kg\\
a = 20 \mss\\
F$_{g}$ = 5000 x 9,8 = 49000 N\\
We are asked to find the thrust of the rocket engine F$_{1}$.\\

\westep{Find the thrust of the engine}
We will apply Newton's Second Law:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{R} &=& ma\\
F_{1}+ F_{g} &=& ma\\
F_{1} + (-49000) &=& (5000)(20)\\
F_{1} &=& 149~000~\rm{N~upwards}\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection{Newton's Third Law of Motion}
Newton's Third Law of Motion deals with the interaction between pairs of objects. For example, if you hold a book up against a wall you are exerting a force on the book (to keep it there) and the book is exerting a force back at you (to keep you from falling through the book). This may sound strange, but if the book was not pushing back at you, your hand would push through the book! These two forces (the force of the hand on the book (F$_{1}$) and the force of the book on the hand (F$_{2}$)) are called an action-reaction pair of forces. They have the same magnitude, but act in opposite directions and act on different objects (the one force is onto the book and the other is onto your hand). \\

There is another action-reaction pair of forces present in this situation. The book is pushing against the wall (action force) and the wall is pushing back at the book (reaction). The force of the book on the wall (F$_{3}$) and the force of the wall on the book (F$_{4}$) are shown in the diagram.

{\westep{Draw a force diagram}
Start by drawing the picture. You will be using arrows to indicate the forces so make your picture large enough so that detailed labels can also be added. The picture needs to be accurate, but not artistic! Use stickmen if you have to.

\westep{Label the diagram}
Take one pair at a time and label them carefully. If there is not enough space on the drawing, then use a key on the side.

\begin{itemize}
\item[A] It is greater than the magnitude of Tammy's weight.
\item[B] It is equal in magnitude to the force Tammy's feet exert on the floor.

\caption{Newton's action-reaction pairs in a lift}
\end{figure}

In this question statements are made about the force of the floor (lift) on Tammy's feet. This force corresponds to F$_{2}$ in our diagram. The reaction force that pairs up with this one is F$_{1}$, which is the force that Tammy's feet exerts on the floor of the lift. The magnitude of these two forces are the same, but they act in opposite directions.\\
\westep{Choose the correct answer}
It is important to analyse the question first, before looking at the answers as the answers might confuse you. Make sure that you understand the situation and know what is asked before you look at the options.\\
The correct answer is B.\\

Note that we had to draw all the forces acting on the book and not the action-reaction pairs. None of the forces drawn are action-reaction pairs, because they all act on the same object (the book). When you label forces, be as specific as possible, including the direction of the force and both objects involved, for example, do not say gravity (which is an incomplete answer) but rather say 'Downward (direction) gravitational force of the Earth (object) on the book (object)'. \\
\westep{State Newton's Third Law}
If body A exerts a force onto body B, then body B will exert a force equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction, onto body A.\\
\westep{Name the action-reaction pairs}
The question only asks for action-reaction forces in the horizontal plane. Therefore:\\
Pair 1: Action: Applied force of the girl on the book; Reaction: The force of the book on the girl.\\
Pair 2: Action: Force of the book on the wall; Reaction: Force of the wall on the book.\\
Note that a Newton III pair will always involve the same combination of words, like 'book on wall' and 'wall on book'. The objects are 'swapped around' in naming the pairs.\\

\Activity{Experiment}{Balloon Rocket}{
\Aim{In this experiment for the entire class, you will use a balloon rocket to investigate Newton's Third Law. A fishing line will be used as a track and a plastic straw taped to the balloon will help attach the balloon to the track.}
\Apparatus{
You will need the following items for this experiment:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{balloons (one for each team)}
\item{plastic straws (one for each team)}
\item{tape (cellophane or masking)}
\item{fishing line, 10 meters in length}
\item{a stopwatch - optional (a cell phone can also be used)}
\item{a measuring tape - optional}
\end{enumerate}}
\Method{
\begin{enumerate}
\item Divide into groups of at least five.
\item Attach one end of the fishing line to the blackboard with tape. Have one teammate hold the other end of the fishing line so that it is taut and roughly horizontal. The line must be held steady and \textbf{must not} be moved up or down during the experiment.
\item Have one teammate blow up a balloon and hold it shut with his or her fingers. Have another teammate tape the straw along the side of the balloon. Thread the fishing line through the straw and hold the balloon at the far end of the line.
\item Let go of the rocket and observe how the rocket moves forward.
\item{Optionally, the rockets of each group can be timed to determine a winner of the fastest rocket.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Assign one teammate to time the event. The balloon should be let go when the time keeper yells ``Go!'' Observe how your rocket moves toward the blackboard.
\item Have another teammate stand right next to the blackboard and yell ``Stop!'' when the rocket hits its target. If the balloon does not make it all the way to the blackboard, ``Stop!'' should be called when the balloon stops moving. The timekeeper should record the flight time.
\item Measure the exact distance the rocket traveled. Calculate the average speed at which the balloon traveled. To do this, divide the distance traveled by the time the balloon was ``in flight.'' Fill in your results for Trial 1 in the Table below.
\item Each team should conduct two more races and complete the sections in the Table for Trials 2 and 3. Then calculate the average speed for the three trials to determine your team's race entry time.
\end{enumerate}
}
\Results{
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline\
& \textbf{Distance (m)} & \textbf{Time (s)} & \textbf{Speed (m$\cdot$s$^{-1}$)}\\\hline
Trial 1 &&&\\\hline
Trial 2 &&&\\\hline
Trial 3 &&&\\\hline
&& Average: & \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
}
\Conclusions{
The winner of this race is the team with the fastest average balloon speed.}
}
\end{enumerate}

While doing the experiment, you should think about,
\begin{enumerate}
\item{What made your rocket move?}
\item{How is Newton's Third Law of Motion demonstrated by this activity?}
\item{Draw pictures using labeled arrows to show the forces acting on the inside of the balloon before it was released and after it was released.}
\end{enumerate}}

\subsection{Different types of forces}

\subsubsection{Tension}
Tension is the magnitude of the force that exists in objects like ropes, chains and struts that are providing support. For example, there are tension forces in the ropes supporting a child's swing hanging from a tree.

\subsubsection{Contact and non-contact forces}
In this chapter we have come across a number of different types of forces, for example a push or a pull, tension in a string, frictional forces and the normal force. These are all examples of contact forces where there is a physical point of contact between applying the force and the object. Non-contact forces are forces that act over a distance, for example magnetic forces, electrostatic forces and gravitational forces.\\
\\
When an object is placed on a surface, two types of surface forces can be identified. Friction is a force that acts between the surface and the object and is parallel to the surface. The normal force is a force that acts between the object and the surface and is perpendicular to the surface.\\

\subsubsection{The normal force}
A 5 kg box is placed on a rough surface and a 10 N force is applied at an angle of 36,9$\degree$ to the horizontal. The box does not move. The normal force (N or F$_N$) is the force between the box and the surface acting in the vertical direction. If this force is not present the box would fall through the surface because the force of gravity pulls it downwards. The normal force therefore acts upwards. We can calculate the normal force by considering all the forces in the vertical direction. All the forces in the vertical direction must add up to zero because there is no movement in the vertical direction.
\begin{eqnarray*}
N + F_y + F_g &=& 0\\
N + 6 + (-49) &=& 0\\
N &=& 43 \eN~ \mbox{upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\caption{Friction and the normal force}
\label{friction and normal}
\end{figure}

The most interesting and illustrative normal force question, that is often asked, has to do with a scale in a lift. Using Newton's third law we can solve these problems quite easily.

When you stand on a scale to measure your weight you are pulled down by gravity. There is no acceleration downwards because there is a reaction force we call the normal force acting upwards on you. This is the force that the scale would measure. If the gravitational force were less then the reading on the scale would be less.

\begin{wex}{Normal Forces 1}{A man with a mass of 100~kg stands on a scale
(measuring newtons). What is the reading on the scale?}

{\westep{Identify what information is given and what is asked for} We are given the mass of the man. We know the gravitational acceleration that acts on him is 9,8~=~\mss .

\westep{Decide what equation to use to solve the problem}
The scale measures the normal force on the man. This is the force that
balances gravity. We can use Newton's laws to solve the problem:
\begin{equation*}
F_r=F_g+F_N
\end{equation*}
where $F_r$ is the resultant force on the man.

\westep {Firstly we determine the force on the man due to gravity}
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_g&=&mg \\
&=& (100\ekg)(9,8\emss)\\
&=& 980\ \mathrm{kg\cdot\emss} \\
&=& 980\eN\ \mathrm{downwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Now determine the normal force acting upwards on the man}
We now know the gravitational force downwards. We know that the sum of all the forces must equal the resultant acceleration times the mass. The overall resultant acceleration of the man on the scale is $0$ - so $F_r=0$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_r&=&F_g+F_N \\
0 &=& -980\eN+F_N\\
F_N &=& 980\eN\ \mathrm{upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Quote the final answer}
The normal force is 980~N upwards. It exactly balances the gravitational force downwards so there is no net force and no acceleration on the man. The reading on the scale is 980 N.}
\end{wex}

Now we are going to add things to exactly the same problem to show how things change slightly. We will now move to a lift moving at constant velocity. Remember if velocity is constant then acceleration is zero.

\begin{wex}{Normal Forces 2}{A man with a mass of 100~kg stands on a scale (measuring newtons) inside a lift that is moving downwards at a constant velocity of 2 \ms. What is the reading on the scale?}
{\westep{Identify what information is given and what is asked for}
We are given the mass of the man and the acceleration of the lift. We know the gravitational acceleration that acts on him.

\westep{Decide which equation to use to solve the problem}
Once again we can use Newton's laws. We know that the sum of all the forces must equal the resultant force, $F_r$.
\begin{equation*}
F_r=F_g+F_N
\end{equation*}

\westep{Determine the force due to gravity}
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_g&=&mg \\
&=& (100\ekg)(9,8\emss)\\
&=& 980\ \mathrm{kg\cdot\emss} \\
&=& 980\eN\ \mathrm{downwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Now determine the normal force acting upwards on the man}
The scale measures this normal force, so once we have determined it we will know the reading on the scale. Because the lift is moving at constant velocity the overall resultant acceleration of the man on the scale is $0$. If we write out the equation:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_r&=&F_g+F_N \\
ma&=&F_g+F_N \\
(100)(0) &=& -980\eN +F_N\\
F_N = 980\eN\ \mathrm{upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Quote the final answer}
The normal force is 980~N upwards. It exactly balances the gravitational force downwards so there is no net force and no acceleration on the man. The reading on the scale is 980 N.}
\end{wex}

In the previous two examples we got exactly the same result because the net acceleration on the man was zero! If the lift is accelerating downwards things are slightly different and now we will get a more interesting answer!

\begin{wex}{Normal Forces 3}{A man with a mass of 100~kg stands on a scale (measuring newtons) inside a lift that is accelerating downwards at 2 \mss. What is the reading on the scale?}
{\westep{Identify what information is given and what is asked for}
We are given the mass of the man and his resultant acceleration - this is just the acceleration of the lift. We know the gravitational acceleration also acts on him.

\westep{Decide which equation to use to solve the problem}
Once again we can use Newton's laws. We know that the sum of all the forces must equal the resultant force, $F_r$.
\begin{equation*}
F_r=F_g+F_N
\end{equation*}

\westep{Determine the force due to gravity, $F_g$}
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_g&=&mg \\
&=& (100\ekg)(9,8\emss)\\
&=& 980\ \mathrm{kg\cdot\emss} \\
&=& 980\eN\ \mathrm{downwards}
\end{eqnarray*}
\westep{Determine the resultant force, $F_r$}
The resultant force can be calculated by applying Newton's Second Law:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_r &=& ma\\
F_r &=& (100\ekg)(-2\emss)\\
&=& -200~N\\
&=& 200~N~\mbox{down}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Determine the normal force, $F_N$}
The sum of all the vertical forces is equal to the resultant force, therefore
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_r&=&F_g + F_N \\
-200\eN &=& -980\eN + F_N\\
F_N &=& 780\eN\ \mathrm{upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Quote the final answer}
The normal force is 780~N upwards. It balances the gravitational force downwards just enough so that the man only accelerates downwards at 2~\mss. The reading on the scale is 780 N.}
\end{wex}

\begin{wex}{Normal Forces 4}{A man with a mass of 100~kg stands on a scale (measuring newtons) inside a lift that is accelerating upwards at 4 \mss. What is the reading on the scale?}
{\westep{Identify what information is given and what is asked for}
We are given the mass of the man and his resultant acceleration - this is just the acceleration of the lift. We know the gravitational acceleration also acts on him.

\westep{Decide which equation to use to solve the problem}
Once again we can use Newton's laws. We know that the sum of all the forces must equal the resultant force, $F_r$.

\begin{equation*}
F_r=F_g+F_N
\end{equation*}

\westep{Determine the force due to gravity, $F_g$}
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_g&=&mg \\
&=& (100\ekg)(9,8\emss)\\
&=& 980\ \mathrm{kg}\cdot\emss \\
&=& 980\eN\ \mathrm{downwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Determine the resultant force, $F_r$}
The resultant force can be calculated by applying Newton's Second Law:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_r &=& ma\\
F_r &=& (100\ekg)(4\emss)\\
&=& 400~N~\mbox{upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Determine the normal force, $F_N$}
The sum of all the vertical forces is equal to the resultant force, therefore
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_r&=&F_g + F_N \\
400\eN &=& -980\eN + F_N\\
F_N &=& 1380\eN\ \mathrm{upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Quote the final answer}
The normal force is 1380~N upwards. It balances the gravitational force downwards and then in addition applies sufficient force to accelerate the man upwards at 4\mss.  The reading on the scale is 1380 N.}
\end{wex}



\subsubsection{Friction forces}
When the surface of one object slides over the surface of another, each body exerts a frictional force on the other. For example if a book slides across a table, the table exerts a frictional force onto the book and the book exerts a frictional force onto the table (Newton's Third Law). Frictional forces act parallel to surfaces.\\

A force is not always powerful enough to make an object move, for example a small applied force might not be able to move a heavy crate. The frictional force opposing the motion of the crate is equal to the applied force but acting in the opposite direction. This frictional force is called \emph{static friction}. When we increase the applied force (push harder), the frictional force will also increase until the applied force overcomes it. This frictional force can vary from zero (when no other forces are present and the object is stationary) to a maximum that depends on the surfaces. When the applied force is greater than the maximum frictional force, the crate will move. Once the object moves, the frictional force will decrease and remain at that level, which is also dependent on the surfaces, while the objects are moving. This is called \emph{kinetic friction}. In both cases the maximum frictional force is related to the normal force and can be calculated as follows:\\
\\
For static friction: F$_f$ $\leq$ $\mu_s$ N\\
\\
Where $\mu_s$ = the coefficient of static friction\\
and N = normal force\\
\\
For kinetic friction: F$_f$ = $\mu_k$ N\\
\\
Where $\mu_k$ = the coefficient of kinetic friction\\
and N = normal force\\
\\
Remember that static friction is present when the object is not moving and kinetic friction while the object is moving. For example when you drive at constant velocity in a car on a tar road you have to keep the accelerator pushed in slightly to overcome the friction between the tar road and the wheels of the car. However, while moving at a constant velocity the wheels of the car are rolling, so this is not a case of two surfaces ``rubbing'' against eachother and we are in fact looking at static friction. If you should break hard, causing the car to skid to a halt, we would be dealing with two surfaces rubbing against eachother and hence kinetic friction. The higher the value for the coefficient of friction, the more 'sticky' the surface is and the lower the value, the more 'slippery' the surface is.\\

The frictional force (F$_f$) acts in the horizontal direction and can be calculated in a similar way to the normal for as long as there is no movement. If we use the same example as in figure \ref{friction and normal} and we choose to the rightward direction as positive,
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_f + F_x &=& 0\\
F_f + (+8) &=& 0\\
F_f &=& -8 \\
F_f &=& 8 \eN~ \mbox{to the left}
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{wex}{Forces on a slope}{A 50 kg crate is placed on a slope that makes an angle of 30$\degree$ with the horizontal. The box does not slide down the slope. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the frictional force and the normal force present in this situation.}{

We often think about friction in a negative way but very often friction is useful without us realizing it. If there was no friction and you tried to prop a ladder up against a wall, it would simply slide to the ground. Rock climbers use friction to maintain their grip on cliffs. The brakes of cars would be useless if it wasn't for friction!

\begin{wex}{Coefficients of friction}{A block of wood weighing 32 N is placed on a rough, flat inclline and a rope is tied to it. The tension in the rope can be increased to 8 N before the block starts to slide. A force of 4 N will keep the block moving at constant speed once it has been set in motion. Determine the coefficients of static and kinetic friction.}
{\westep{Analyse the question and determine what is asked}
The weight of the block is given (32 N) and two situations are identified: One where the block is not moving (applied force is 8 N), and one where the block is moving (applied force is 4 N). \\
We are asked to find the coefficient for static friction $\mu_s$ and kinetic friction $\mu_k$.\\
\westep{Find the coefficient of static friction}
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_f &=& \mu_s N\\
8 &=& \mu_s (32)\\
\mu_s &=& 0,25
\end{eqnarray*}
Note that the coefficient of friction does not have a unit as it shows a ratio. The value for the coefficient of friction friction can have any value up to a maximum of 0,25. When a force less than 8 N is applied, the coefficient of friction will be less than 0,25.\\

\westep{Find the coefficient of kinetic friction}

\subsection{Forces in equilibrium}
At the beginning of this chapter it was mentioned that resultant forces cause objects to accelerate in a straight line. If an object is stationary or moving at constant velocity then either,
\begin{itemize}
\item{no forces are acting on the object, or}
\item{the forces acting on that object are exactly balanced.}
\end{itemize}
In other words, for stationary objects or objects moving with constant velocity, the resultant force acting on the object is zero. Additionally, if there is a perpendicular moment of force, then the object will rotate. You will learn more about moments of force later in this chapter.

Therefore, in order for an object not to move or to be in \textit{equilibrium}, the sum of the forces (resultant force) must be zero and the sum of the moments of force must be zero.

\Definition{Equilibrium}{An object in equilibrium has both the sum of the forces acting on it and the sum of the moments of the forces equal to zero.}

If a resultant force acts on an object then that object can be brought into equilibrium by applying an additional force that exactly balances this resultant. Such a force is called the {\em equilibrant} and is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the original resultant force acting on the object.

\Definition{Equilibrant}{The equilibrant of any number of forces is the single force required to produce equilibrium, and is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the resultant force.}

In the figure the resultant of $F_1$ and $F_2$ is shown. The equilibrant of $F_1$ and $F_2$ is then the vector opposite in direction to this resultant with the same magnitude (i.e. $F_3$).

\begin{itemize}
\item{ $F_1$, $F_2$ and $F_3$ are in equilibrium}
\item{ $F_3$ is the equilibrant of $F_1$ and
$F_2$}
\item{$F_1$ and

\end{itemize}

As an example of an object in equilibrium, consider an object held stationary by two ropes in the arrangement below:

Let us draw a free body diagram for the object. In the free body diagram the
object is drawn as a dot and all forces acting on the object are drawn in the correct directions starting from that dot. In this case, three forces are acting on the object.

Each rope exerts a force on the object in the direction of the rope away from the object. These tension forces are represented by $T_1$ and $T_2$. Since the object has mass, it is attracted towards the centre of the Earth. This weight is represented in the force diagram as $F_g$.

Since the object is stationary, the resultant force acting on the object is zero. In other words the three force vectors drawn tail-to-head form a closed triangle:

in the initial situation.
\item Determine the tension in the chain initially.
\item Draw a free body diagram representing the forces acting on the engine
in the final situation.
\item Determine the magnitude of the applied force and the tension in the chain in the final situations.

\end{enumerate}}
{\westep{Initial free body diagram for the engine}
There are only two forces acting on the engine initially: the tension in the chain, $T_{chain}$ and the weight of the engine, $F_g$.

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-1,-2)(1,2)
\psdot[dotsize=0.2](0,0)

\rput(-0.6,1){$T_{chain}$}
\rput(-0.4,-1){$F_g$}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}
\westep{Determine the tension in the chain}
The engine is initially stationary, which means that the resultant force on
the engine is zero. There are also no moments of force. Thus the tension in the chain exactly balances the weight of the engine. The tension in the chain is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
T_{chain} &=& F_g\\
&=& 2000\eN
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Final free body diagram for the engine}
There are three forces acting on the engine finally: The tension in the chain, the applied force and the weight of the engine.

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(0.6,-2)(3.8,2.8)
\psline[arrowscale=2]{->}(3,-2)(0.69,2)

\psarc{-}(3,-2){1.5}{90}{120}
\rput(2.7,-0.8){$30^{\circ}$}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

\westep{Calculate the magnitude of the applied force and the tension in the chain in the final situation}
Since no method was specified let us calculate the magnitudes algebraically. Since the triangle formed by the three forces is a right-angle triangle this is easily done:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{F_{applied}}{F_g} &=& \tan30^{\circ}\\
F_{applied} &=& (2000\eN)\tan30^{\circ}\\
&=& 1\,155\eN
\end{eqnarray*}
and
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{T_{chain}}{F_g} &=& \frac{1}{\cos30^{\circ}}\\
T_{chain} &=& \frac{2000\eN}{\cos30^{\circ}}\\
&=& 2\,309\eN
\end{eqnarray*}}

\section{Forces between Masses}

In Grade 10, you saw that gravitational fields exert forces on masses in the field. A field is a region of space in which an object experiences a force. The strength of a field is defined by a field strength. For example, the gravitational field strength, $g$, on or near the surface of the Earth has a value that is approximately 9,8 \mss.

The force exerted by a field of strength $g$ on an object of mass $m$ is given by:
\equ{F=m\cdot g}{eq:p:m:fmi11:weight}
This can be re-written in terms of $g$ as:
\nequ{g=\frac{F}{m}}
This means that $g$ can be understood to be a measure of force exerted per unit mass.

The force defined in Equation~\ref{eq:p:m:fmi11:weight} is known as weight.

Objects in a gravitational field exert forces on each other without touching. The gravitational force is an example of a non-contact force.

Gravity is a force and therefore must be described by a vector - so remember thta gravity has both magnitude and direction.

%\pagebreak[4]
\subsection{Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation}

\Definition{Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation}{Every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force directed along the line connecting the two. This force is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.}

The magnitude of the attractive gravitational force between the two point masses, $F$ is given by:
\equ{F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}}{eq:newtongravitation}
where:
$G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ is the mass of the first point mass, $m_2$ is the mass of the second point mass and $r$ is the distance between the two point masses.

Assuming SI units, $F$ is measured in newtons (N), $m_1$ and $m_2$ in kilograms (kg), $r$ in meters (m), and the constant $G$ is approximately equal to $6,67 \times 10^{-11} N\cdot m^2\cdot~kg^{-2}$. Remember that this is a force of attraction.

For example, consider a man of mass 80~kg standing 10 m from a woman with a mass of 65~kg. The attractive gravitational force between them would be:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F &=& G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\\
&=& (6,67 \times 10^{-11}\eN\cdot m^2\cdot~kg^{-2})(\frac{(80 kg)(65 kg)}{(10 m)^2})\\
&=&3,47 \times 10^{-9}\eN
\end{eqnarray*}
If the man and woman move to 1 m apart, then the force is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F &=& G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\\
&=& (6,67 \times 10^{-11}\eN\cdot m^2\cdot~kg^{-2})(\frac{(80 kg)(65 kg)}{(1 m)^2})\\
&=&3,47 \times 10^{-7}\eN
\end{eqnarray*}

As you can see, these forces are very small.

Now consider the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon. The mass of the Earth is $5,98\times 10^{24}$~kg, the mass of the Moon is $7,35\times 10^{22}$~kg and the Earth and Moon are $3,8 \times 10^{8}$~m apart. The gravitational force between the Earth and Moon is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F &=& G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\\
&=& (6,67 \times 10^{-11}\eN\cdot m^2\cdot~kg^{-2})(\frac{(5,98\times 10^{24} kg)(7,35\times 10^{22} kg)}{(0,38 \times 10^{9} m)^2})\\
&=&2,03\times 10^{20}\eN
\end{eqnarray*}

From this example you can see that the force is very large.

These two examples demonstrate that the greater the masses, the greater the force between them. The $1/r^2$ factor tells us that the distance between the two bodies plays a role as well. The closer two bodies are, the
stronger the gravitational force between them is. We feel the gravitational attraction of the Earth most at the surface since that is the closest we can get to it, but if we were in outer-space, we would barely feel the effect of the Earth's gravity!

Remember that
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_Fma_again}
F=m\cdot a
\end{equation}
which means that every object on Earth feels the same gravitational acceleration! That means whether you drop a pen or a book (from the same height), they will both take the same length of time to hit the ground... in fact they will be head to head for the entire fall if you drop them at the
same time. We can show this easily by using the two equations above (Equations~\ref{eq:newtongravitation} and \ref{eqn_Fma_again}). The force between the Earth (which has the mass $m_e$) and an object of mass $m_o$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_gravex1_1}
F=\frac{G m_o m_e}{r^2}
\end{equation}
and the acceleration of an object of mass $m_o$ (in terms of the force acting on it) is
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_gravex1_2}
a_o=\frac{F}{m_o}
\end{equation}
So we substitute equation (\ref{eqn_gravex1_1}) into Equation~(\ref{eqn_gravex1_2}), and we find that
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn_gravex1_3}
a_o=\frac{G m_e}{r^2}
\end{equation}
Since it doesn't matter what $m_o$ is, this tells us that the acceleration on a body (due to the Earth's gravity) does not depend on the mass of the body. Thus all objects experience the same gravitational acceleration. The force on different bodies will be different but the acceleration will be the same. Due to the fact that this acceleration caused by gravity is the same on all objects we label it differently, instead of using $a$ we use $g$ which we call the gravitational acceleration.

\subsection{Comparative Problems}
Comparative problems involve calculation of something in terms of something else that we know. For example, if you weigh 490 N on Earth and the gravitational acceleration on Venus is 0,903 that of the gravitational acceleration on the Earth, then you would weigh 0,903~x~490~N~=~442,5~N on Venus.

%Falling Bodies - left out here as it is done in grade 12.

%Badly written - rewrite!! Not in syllabus
%\Extension{Terminal Velocity}{Physics is all about being simple - all we do is look at the world around us and notice how it really works. It is the one thing everyone is qualified to do - we spend most of our time when we are really young experimenting to find out how things work.

%Take a book - wave it in the air - change the angle and direction. what happens of course there is resistance. different angles make it greater - the faster the book moves the greater it is. The bigger the area of the book moving in the direction of motion the greater the force.

%So we know that air resistance exists! it is a force. So what happens when an object falls? of course there is air resistance - or drag as it is normally called. There is an approximate formula for the drag force as well. The important thing to realise is that when the drag force and the gravitational force are equal for a falling body there is no net force acting on it - which means no net acceleration. That does not mean it does not move - but it means that its speed does not change.

%It falls at a constant velocity! This velocity is called terminal velocity.}

%Not in syllabus - too little said here, must write much more or leave out.
%\Extension{Drag force}{The actual force of air resistance is quite complicated. Experiment by moving a book through the air with the face of the book and then the side of the book forward, you will agree that the area of the book makes a difference as to how much you must work in order to move the book at the same speed in both cases. This is why racing cars are slim-lined in design, and not shaped like a big box!

%Get a plastic container lid (or anything waterproof) swing it around in air and then try to swing it around under water. The density of the water is much larger than the air, making you have to work harder at swinging the lid in water. This is why boats and submarines are a lot slower than aeroplanes! So we know that density, area and speed all play a role in the drag force. The expression we use for drag force is \begin{equation} D=\frac{1}{2}C\rho Av^2 \end{equation} where $C$ is a constant which depends on the object and fluid interactions, $\rho$ is the density, $A$ is the area and $v$ is the velocity.}

\section{Momentum and Impulse}

Momentum is a physical quantity which is closely related to forces. Momentum is a property which applies to moving objects.

\Definition{Momentum}{Momentum is the tendency of an object to continue to move in its direction of travel. Momentum is calculated from the product of the mass and velocity of an object.}

The momentum (symbol $p$) of an object of mass $m$ moving at velocity $v$ is:
\nequ{p=m \cdot v}

According to this equation, momentum is related to both the mass and velocity of an object. A small car travelling at the same velocity as a big truck will have a smaller momentum than the truck. The smaller the mass, the smaller the velocity.\\
A car travelling at 120~\kph will have a bigger momentum than the same car travelling at 60 \kph. Momentum is also related to velocity; the smaller the velocity, the smaller the momentum.\\
Different objects can also have the same momentum, for example a car travelling slowly can have the same momentum as a motor cycle travelling relatively fast. We can easily demonstrate this. Consider a car of mass 1~000~kg with a velocity of 8 \ms (about 30 \kph). The momentum of the car is therefore
\begin{eqnarray*}
p&=&m \cdot v\\
&=& (1000 \ekg)(8 \ems)\\
&=& 8000 \ekg\cdot\ems
\end{eqnarray*}

Now consider a motor cycle of mass 250~kg travelling at 32 \ms\ (about 115 \kph). The momentum of the motor cycle is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p&=&m \cdot v\\
&=& (250 \ekg)(32 \ems)\\
&=& 8000 \ekg \cdot \ems
\end{eqnarray*}

Even though the motor cycle is considerably lighter than the car, the fact that the motor cycle is travelling much faster than the car means that the momentum of both vehicles is the same.\\
\\
From the calculations above, you are able to derive the unit for momentum as kg$\cdot$\ms.\\
Momentum is also vector quantity, because it is the product of a scalar ($m$) with a vector ($v$).\\This means that whenever we calculate the momentum of an object, we need to include the direction of the momentum.

\item the distance to the Moon (384 400 km = 384 400 000 m = 3,844 x 10$^8$ m)
\item the time for one orbit of the Moon (27,3 days = 27,3 x 24 x 60 x 60 = 2,36 x 10$^6$ s)
\end{itemize}

We are asked to calculate only the magnitude of the momentum of the Moon (i.e. we do not need to specify a direction). In order to do this we require the mass and the magnitude of the velocity of the Moon, since
\nequ{p = m \cdot v}

\westep{Find the magnitude of the velocity of the Moon}
The magnitude of the average velocity is the same as the speed. Therefore:
\nequ{s = \frac{d}{\Delta t}}

We are given the time the Moon takes for one orbit but not how far it travels in that time. However, we can work this out from the distance to the Moon and the fact that the Moon has a circular orbit. Using the equation for the circumference, $C$, of a circle in terms of its radius, we can determine the distance travelled by the Moon in one
orbit:
\begin{eqnarray*}
C&=&2\pi r\\
&=&2\pi (3,844\times10^8 \mathrm{m})\\
&=& 2,42\times10^{9}\ \mathrm{m}
\end{eqnarray*}

Combining the distance travelled by the Moon in an orbit and the time
taken by the Moon to complete one orbit, we can determine the
magnitude of the Moon's velocity or speed,
\begin{eqnarray*}
s &=& \frac{d}{\Delta t}\\
&=& \frac{C}{T}\\
&=& \frac{2,42 \times 10^9 m}{2,36 \times 10^6 s}\\
&=& 1,02\times 10^{3}\ems.
\end{eqnarray*}
\westep{Finally calculate the momentum and quote the answer}
The magnitude of the Moon's momentum is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p &=& m \cdot v\\
&=& (7,35\times 10^{22} \ekg)(1,02\times 10^{3} \ems)\\
&=& 7,50 \times 10^{25}\ekg \cdot \ems
\end{eqnarray*}}
\end{wex}

\subsection{Vector Nature of Momentum}
As we have said, momentum is a vector quantity. Since momentum is a vector, the techniques of vector addition discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:vectors} must be used to calculate the total momentum of a system.

\begin{wex}{Calculating the Total Momentum of a System}{Two billiard balls roll towards each other. They each have a mass of 0,3~kg. Ball 1 is moving at $v_1=1\ems$ to the right, while ball 2 is moving at $v_2=0,8\ems$ to the left. Calculate the total momentum of the system.}{
\westep{Identify what information is given and what is asked for} The question
explicitly gives
\begin{itemize}
\item the mass of each ball,
\item the velocity of ball 1, $v_1$, and
\item the velocity of ball 2, $v_2$,
\end{itemize}
all in the correct units!

We are asked to calculate the {\bf total momentum of
the system}. In this example our system consists of two balls. To find
the total momentum we must determine the momentum of each ball and add them.

\nequ{p_{total} = p_1 + p_2}

Since ball 1 is moving to the right, its momentum is in this direction,
while the second ball's momentum is directed towards the left.

\begin{center}
\begin{pspicture}(-3,-1)(3,1)%\psgrid
\psline{-}(-2.8,-0.5)(2.8,-0.5)
\pscircle(-2,0.){0.5}
\psline{->}(-1.5,0.)(-0.5,0.)
\rput(-1,-0.25){$v_1$}
\rput(-2,0.){$m_1$}
\pscircle(2,0.){0.5}
\psline{->}(1.5,0)(0.7,0.)
\rput(1.1,-0.25){$v_2$}
\rput(2,0.){$m_2$}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}

Thus, we are required to find the sum of two vectors acting along the
same straight line. The algebraic method of vector addition introduced
in Chapter~\ref{chap:vectors} can thus be used.\\

\westep{Choose a frame of reference} Let us choose right as the
positive direction, then obviously left is negative.\\

\westep{Calculate the momentum} The total momentum of the system is then the sum of the two momenta taking the
directions of the velocities into account. Ball 1 is travelling
at 1 \ms to the right or +1 \ms. Ball 2 is travelling at 0,8 \ms to the left or -0,8 \ms. Thus,
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{total} &=& m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2\\
&=& (0,3 \ekg)(+1 \ems) + (0,3 \ekg)(-0,8 \ems)\\
&=& (+0,3 \ekg\cdot\ems) + (-0,24 \ekg\cdot\ems) \\
&=& +0,06\ekg \cdot \ems\\
&=& 0,06\ekg \cdot \ems \mbox{to the right}
\end{eqnarray*}
In the last step the direction was added in words. Since the result
in the second last line is positive, the total momentum of the system
is in the positive direction (i.e. to the right).}
\end{wex}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Change in Momentum}

Let us consider a tennis ball (mass = 0,1 kg) that is dropped at an initial velocity of 5 \ms and bounces back at a final velocity of 3 \ms. As the ball approaches the floor it has a momentum that we call the momentum before the collision. When it moves away from the floor it has a different momentum called the momentum after the collision. The bounce on the floor can be thought of as a collision taking place where the floor exerts a force on the tennis ball to change its momentum.\\



The momentum before the bounce can be calculated as follows:\\
Because momentum and velocity are vectors, we have to choose a direction as positive. For this example we choose the initial direction of motion as positive, in other words, downwards is positive.
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{i} &=& m \cdot v_{i}\\
&=& (0,1 \ekg)(+5 \ems)\\
&=& 0,5\ \ekg\cdot\ems \mbox{downwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

When the tennis ball bounces back it changes direction. The final velocity will thus have a negative value.
The momentum after the bounce can be calculated as follows:\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{f} &=& m \cdot v_{f}\\
&=& (0,1 \ekg)(-3 \ems)\\
&=& -0,3 \ekg\cdot\ems\\
&=& 0,3\ \ekg\cdot\ems \mbox{upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

Now let us look at what happens to the momentum of the tennis ball. The momentum changes during this bounce. We can calculate the change in momentum as follows:\\
Again we have to choose a direction as positive and we will stick to our initial choice as downwards is positive. This means that the final momentum will have a negative number. \\
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta p &=& p_{f} - p_{i}\\
&=& m \cdot v_{f} - m \cdot v_{i}\\
&=& (-0,3 \ekg) - (0,5 \ems)\\
&=& -0,8 \ekg\cdot\ems\\
&=& 0,8\ \ekg\cdot\ems \mbox{upwards}
\end{eqnarray*}

You will notice that this number is bigger than the previous momenta calculated. This is should be the case as the ball needed to be stopped and then given momentum to bounce back. \\

\subsection{Newton's Second Law revisited}
You have learned about Newton's Second Law of motion earlier in this chapter.
Newton's Second Law describes the relationship between the motion of an object and the net force on the object. We said that the motion of an object, and therefore its momentum, can only change when a resultant force is acting on it. We can therefore say that because a net force causes an object to move, it also causes its momentum to change. We can now define Newton's Second Law of motion in terms of momentum.\\

\Definition{Newton's Second Law of Motion (N2)}{The net or resultant force acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of momentum.}

Mathematically, Newton's Second Law can be stated as:
\nequ{F_{net}=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}}

\subsection{Impulse}
Impulse is the product of the net force and the time interval for which the force acts. Impulse is defined as:
\equ{\mathrm{Impulse}=F\cdot \Delta t}{eq:impulse}
However, from Newton's Second Law, we know that
\begin{eqnarray*}
F&=&\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}\\
\therefore\quad F \cdot \Delta t\ &=& \Delta p\\
&=&\mathrm{Impulse}
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore,
\nequ{\mathrm{Impulse}=\Delta p}

Impulse is equal to the change in momentum of an object. From this equation we see, that for a given change in momentum, $F_{net}\Delta t$ is fixed. Thus, if $F_{net}$ is reduced, $\Delta t$ must be increased (i.e. a smaller resultant force must be applied for longer to bring about the same change in momentum). Alternatively if $\Delta t$ is reduced (i.e. the resultant force is applied for a shorter period) then the resultant force must be increased to bring about the same change in momentum.\\

\begin{wex}{Impulse and Change in momentum}{A 150 N resultant force acts on a 300 kg trailer. Calculate how long it takes this force to change the trailer's velocity from 2 \ms to 6 \ms in the same direction. Assume that the forces acts to the right.}
{\westep{Identify what information is given and what is asked for}
The question explicitly gives
\begin{itemize}
\item{the trailer's mass as 300 kg,}
\item{the trailer's initial velocity as 2 \ms to the right,}
\item{the trailer's final velocity as 6 \ms to the right, and}
\item{the resultant force acting on the object}
\end{itemize}
all in the correct units!

We are asked to calculate the time taken $\Delta t$ to accelerate the trailer from the 2 to 6 \ms. From the Law of Momentum,
\begin{eqnarray*}
{F}_{net}\Delta t &=& \Delta p \\
&=& mv_f-mv_i\\
&=& m(v_f - v_i).
\end{eqnarray*}

Thus we have everything we need to find $\Delta t$!\\

\westep{Choose a frame of reference}
Choose right as the positive direction.\\

\westep{Do the calculation and quote the final answer}
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{net}\Delta t &=& m(v_f - v_i)\\
(+150 \eN)\Delta t &=& (300 \ekg)((+6 \ems)-(+2 \ems))\\
(+150 \eN)\Delta t &=& (300 \ekg)(+4 \ems)\\
\Delta t &=& \frac{(300 \ekg)(+4 \ems)}{+150 \eN}\\
\Delta t &=& 8\es
\end{eqnarray*}
It takes 8~s for the force to change the object's velocity from 2 \ms to the right to 6 \ms to the right.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item the ball's impulse, and
\item the average force exerted by the bat if the ball is in contact with the bat for 0,13~s.
\end{enumerate}}{\westep{Identify what information is given and what is asked for}
The question explicitly gives
\begin{itemize}
\item the ball's mass,
\item the ball's initial velocity,
\item the ball's final velocity, and
\item the time of contact between bat and ball
\end{itemize}

We are asked to calculate the impulse
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Impulse} = \Delta p = F_{net}\Delta t
\end{equation*}
Since we do not have the force exerted by the bat on the ball (F$_{net}$), we have to calculate the impulse from the change in momentum of the ball. Now, since
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta p &=& p_{f}-p_{i}\\
&=& mv_f - mv_i,
\end{eqnarray*}
we need the ball's mass, initial velocity and final velocity, which we are given.\\
\westep{Convert to S.I. units}
Firstly let us change units for the mass
\begin{eqnarray*}
1000\ \mathrm{g} &=& 1\ekg\\
\mbox{So, }1\ \mathrm{g} &=& \frac{1}{1000}\ \mathrm{kg}\\
\therefore 156 \times 1\ \mathrm{g} &=& 156 \times \frac{1}{1000}\ \mathrm{kg}\\
&=& 0,156~\ekg
\end{eqnarray*}
Next we change units for the velocity
\begin{eqnarray*}
1\ \mathrm{km\cdot h^{-1}} &=& \frac{1000 \emm}{3\ 600\es}\\
\therefore 54 \times 1\ \mathrm{km\cdot h^{-1}} &=& 54 \times \frac{1\,000 \emm}{3\,600\es}\\
&=&15\ems
\end{eqnarray*}

Similarly, 36 \kph = 10 \ms.\\

\westep{Choose a frame of reference}
Let us choose the direction from the batsman to the bowler as the positive direction. Then the initial velocity of the ball is $v_i$ = -15 \ms, while the final velocity of the ball is $v_f$ = 10 \ms.

\westep{Calculate the momentum}
Now we calculate the change in momentum,
\begin{eqnarray*}
p &=& p_{f} - p_{i}\\
&=& mv_f - mv_i\\
&=& m(v_f - v_i)\\
&=&(0,156 \ekg)((+10 \ems)-(-15 \ems))\\
&=& +3,9 \ekg\cdot\ems\\
&=& 3,9 \ekg\cdot\ems \mbox{in the direction from batsman to bowler}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Determine the impulse}
Finally since impulse is just the change in momentum of the ball,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{Impulse} &=& \Delta p\\
&=& 3,9 \ekg\cdot\ems \mbox{in the direction from batsman to bowler}
\end{eqnarray*}

\westep{Determine the average force exerted by the bat}
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Impulse} = F_{net}\Delta t = \Delta p
\end{equation*}
We are given $\Delta t$ and we have calculated the impulse of the ball.
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{net}\Delta t &=& \mathrm{Impulse}\\
F_{net}(0,13 \es) &=& +3,9 \eN\cdot\es\\
F_{net} &=& \frac{+3,9\eN\cdot\es}{0,13\es}\\
&=& +30 \eN\\
&=& 30\eN\quad \mbox{in the direction from batsman to bowler}

\subsection{Conservation of Momentum}
In the absence of an external force acting on a system, momentum is conserved.

\Definition{Conservation of Linear Momentum}{The total linear momentum of an isolated system is constant. An isolated system has no forces acting on it from the outside.}

This means that in an isolated system the total momentum before a collision or explosion is equal to the total momentum after the collision or explosion.

Consider a simple collision of two billiard balls. The balls are rolling on a frictionless surface and the system is isolated. So, we can apply conservation of momentum. The first ball has a mass $m_1$ and an initial velocity $v_{i1}$. The second ball has a mass $m_2$ and moves towards the first ball with an initial velocity $v_{i2}$. This
situation is shown in Figure~\ref{fig_mom1}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\end{pspicture}
\end{center}
\caption{Before the collision.}
\label{fig_mom1}
\end{figure}

The total momentum of the system before the collision, $p_i$ is:
\nequ{p_{i}=m_1v_{i1} + m_2v_{i2}}

After the two balls collide and move away they each have a different momentum. If the first ball has a final velocity of $v_{f1}$ and the second ball has a final velocity of $v_{f2}$ then we have the situation shown in Figure~\ref{fig_mom2}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\uput[u](2.5,0.5){$v_{f2}$}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}
\caption{After the collision.}
\label{fig_mom2}
\end{figure}

The total momentum of the system after the collision, $p_f$ is:
\nequ{p_{f}=m_1v_{f1} + m_2v_{f2}}

This system of two balls is isolated since there are no external forces acting on the balls. Therefore, by the principle of conservation of linear momentum, the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. This gives the equation for the conservation of momentum in a collision of two objects,

\begin{center}
\psshadowbox{
\begin{tabular}{rl}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{$p_{i}=p_{f}$}\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{$m_1v_{i1} + m_2v_{i2} = m_1v_{f1} + m_2v_{f2}$}\\
\\
$m_1$&: mass of object 1 (kg)\\
$m_2$&: mass of object 2 (kg)\\
$v_{i1}$&: initial velocity of object 1 (\ms + direction)\\
$v_{i2}$&: initial velocity of object 2 (\ms - direction)\\
$v_{f1}$&: final velocity of object 1 (\ms - direction)\\
$v_{f2}$&: final velocity of object 2 (\ms + direction)\\
\end{tabular}}
\end{center}

This equation is always true - momentum is always conserved in collisions.

\begin{wex}{Conservation of Momentum 1}

(5000\ekg + 50\ekg)(275 \ems) &=& (5000 \ekg)(v_{f1}) + (50 \ekg)(700 \ems)\\

\subsection{Physics in Action: Impulse}
A very important application of impulse is improving safety and reducing injuries. In many cases, an object needs to be brought to rest from a certain initial velocity. This means there is a certain specified change in momentum. If the time during which the momentum changes can be increased then the force that must be applied will be less and so it will cause less damage. This is the principle behind arrestor beds for trucks, airbags, and bending your knees when you jump off a chair and land on the ground.

\subsubsection{Air-Bags in Motor Vehicles}
Air bags are used in motor vehicles because they are able to reduce the effect of the force experienced by a person during an accident. Air bags extend the time required to stop the momentum of the driver and passenger. During a collision, the motion of the driver and passenger carries them towards the windshield. If they are stopped by a collision with the windshield, it would result in a large force exerted over a short time in order to bring them to a stop. If instead of hitting the windshield, the driver and passenger hit an air bag, then the time of the impact is increased. Increasing the time of the impact results in a decrease in the force.

\subsubsection{Padding as Protection During Sports}
The same principle explains why wicket keepers in cricket use padded gloves or why there are padded mats in gymnastics. In cricket, when the wicket keeper catches the ball, the padding is slightly compressible, thus reducing the effect of the force on the wicket keepers hands. Similarly, if a gymnast falls, the padding compresses and reduces the effect of the force on the gymnast's body.

\subsubsection{Arrestor Beds for Trucks}
An arrestor bed is a patch of ground that is softer than the road. Trucks use these when they have to make an emergency stop. When a trucks reaches an arrestor bed the time interval over which the momentum is changed is increased. This decreases the force and causes the truck to slow down.

\subsubsection{Follow-Through in Sports}
In sports where rackets and bats are used, like tennis, cricket, squash, badminton and baseball, the hitter is often encouraged to follow-through when striking the ball. High speed films of the collisions between bats/rackets and balls have shown that following through increases the time over which the collision between the racket/bat and ball occurs. This increase in the time of the collision causes an increase in the velocity change of the ball. This means that a hitter can cause the ball to leave the racket/bat faster by following through. In these sports, returning the ball with a higher velocity often increases the chances of success.

\subsubsection{Crumple Zones in Cars}
Another safety application of trying to reduce the force experienced is in crumple zones in cars. When two cars have a collision, two things can happen:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the cars bounce off each other, or
\item the cars crumple together.
\end{enumerate}

Which situation is more dangerous for the occupants of the cars? When cars bounce off each other, or rebound, there is a larger change in momentum and therefore a larger impulse. A larger impulse means that a greater force is experienced by the occupants of the cars. When cars crumple together, there is a smaller change in momentum and therefore a smaller impulse. The smaller impulse means that the occupants of the cars experience a smaller force. Car manufacturers use this idea and design crumple zones into cars, such that the car has a greater chance of crumpling than rebounding in a collision. Also, when the car crumples, the change in the car's momentum happens over a longer time. Both these effects result in a smaller force on the occupants of the car, thereby increasing their chances of survival.

\Activity{Egg Throw}{This activity demonstrates the effect of impulse and how it is used to improve safety. Have two learners hold up a bed sheet or large piece of fabric. Then toss an egg at the sheet. The egg should not break, because the collision between the egg and the bed sheet lasts over an extended period of time since the bed sheet has some give in it. By increasing the time of the collision, the force of the impact is minimized. Take care to aim at the sheet, because if you miss the sheet, you will definitely break the egg and have to clean up the mess!}

\item Calculate the distance that the loaded truck moves after collision, if a constant frictional force of 24 kN acts on the truck.

\item Calculate the speed of the bullet-and-block system immediately after impact.

\section{Torque and Levers}
\subsection{Torque}

This chapter has dealt with forces and how they lead to motion in a straight line. In this section, we examine how forces lead to rotational motion.

When an object is fixed or supported at one point and a force acts on it a distance away from the support, it tends to make the object turn. The moment of force or \textit{torque} (symbol, $\tau$ read \textit{tau}) is defined as the product of the distance from the support or pivot ($r$) and the component of force perpendicular to the object, $F_{\perp}$.

\equ{\tau=F_{\perp} \cdot r}{eq:fmig11:torque}

Torque can be seen as a rotational force. The unit of torque is N$\cdot$m and torque is a vector quantity. Some examples of where torque arises are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:fmig11:torque:seesaw}, \ref{fig:fmig11:torque:propellor} and \ref{fig:fmig11:torque:spanner}.

\label{fig:fmig11:torque:spanner}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

For example in Figure~\ref{fig:fmig11:torque:spanner}, if a force $F$ of 10~N is applied perpendicularly to the spanner at a distance $r$ of 0,3~m from the center of the bolt, then the torque applied to the bolt is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tau&=&F_{\perp} \cdot r\\
&=&(10\,\eN)(0,3\emm)\\
&=&3\,\mathrm{N\cdot m}
\end{eqnarray*}
If the force of 10~N is now applied at a distance of 0,15~m from the centre of the bolt, then the torque is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tau&=&F_{\perp} \cdot r\\
&=&(10\,\eN)(0,15\emm)\\
&=&1,5\,\mathrm{N\cdot m}
\end{eqnarray*}
This shows that there is less torque when the force is applied closer to the bolt than further away.

\Tip{Loosening a bolt}{If you are trying to loosen (or tighten) a bolt, apply the force on the spanner further away from the bolt, as this results in a greater torque to the bolt making it easier to loosen.}

\Tip{Any component of a force exerted parallel to an object will not cause the object to turn. Only perpendicular components cause turning.}

\Tip{Torques}{The direction of a torque is either clockwise or anticlockwise. When torques are added, choose one direction as positive and the opposite direction as negative. If equal clockwise and anticlockwise torques are applied to an object, they will cancel out and there will be no net turning effect.}

\subsection{Mechanical Advantage and Levers}
We can use our knowlegde about the moments of forces (torque) to determine whether situations are balanced. For example two mass pieces are placed on a seesaw as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fmig11:torque:balance}. The one mass is 3 kg and the other is 6 kg. The masses are placed at distances of 2 m and 1 m (respectively) from the pivot. By looking at the clockwise and anti-clockwise moments, we can determine whether the seesaw will pivot (move) or not. If the sum of the clockwise and anti-clockwise moments is zero, the seesaw is in equilibrium (i.e. balanced).

\end{pspicture}
\caption{The moments of force are balanced.}
\label{fig:fmig11:torque:balance}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The clockwise moment can be calculated as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tau_1 &=& F_{\perp}\cdot r\\
\tau_1 &=& (6 \ekg)(9,8 \emss)(1 m)\\
\tau_1 &=& 58,8 N \cdot m~\mbox{clockwise}
\end{eqnarray*}


The anti-clockwise moment can be calculated as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tau_2 &=& F_{\perp}\cdot r\\
\tau_2 &=& (3 \ekg)(9,8 \emss)(2 m)\\
\tau_2 &=& 58,8 N \cdot m~ \mbox{anti-clockwise}
\end{eqnarray*}

The sum of the moments of force will be zero:

The resultant moment is zero as the clockwise and anti-clockwise moments of force are in opposite directions and therefore cancel each other. \\

As we see in Figure~\ref{fig:fmig11:torque:balance}, we can use different distances away from a pivot to balance two different forces. This principle is applied to a lever to make lifting a heavy object much easier.

\Definition{Lever}{A lever is a rigid object that is used with an appropriate fulcrum or pivot point to multiply the mechanical force that can be applied to another object.}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{IFact}{Archimedes reputedly said: \textit{Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.}}\end{IFact}

The concept of getting out more than the effort is termed mechanical advantage, and is one example of the principle of moments. The lever allows one to apply a smaller force over a greater distance. For instance to lift a certain unit of weight with a lever with an effort of half a unit we need a distance from the fulcrum in the effort's side to be twice the distance of the weight's side. It also means that to lift the weight 1 meter we need to push the lever for 2 meters. The amount of work done is always the same and independent of the dimensions of the lever (in an ideal lever). The lever only allows to trade force for distance.

Ideally, this means that the mechanical advantage of a system is the ratio of the force that performs the work (output or load) to the applied force (input or effort), assuming there is no friction in the system. In reality, the mechanical advantage will be less than the ideal value by an amount determined by the amount of friction.

\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{mechanical~advantage}=\frac{\mathrm{load}}{\mathrm{effort}}
\end{equation*}

For example, you want to raise an object of mass 100~kg. If the pivot is placed as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fmig11:torque:mechanicaladvantage:example}, what is the mechanical advantage of the lever?

\end{pspicture}
\caption{A lever is used to put in a small effort to get out a large load.}
\label{fig:fmig11:torque:mechanicaladvantage:example}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In order to calculate mechanical advantage, we need to determine the load and effort.

\Tip{Effort is the input force and load is the output force.}

The load is easy to calculate, it is simply the weight of the 100~kg object.
\nequ{F_{load}=m \cdot g = 100\ekg \cdot 9,8\emss = 980\eN}

The effort is found by balancing torques.
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{load}\cdot r_{load} &=& F_{effort}\cdot r_{effort} \\
980\eN \cdot 0.5\emm &=&F_{effort} \cdot 1\emm\\
F_{effort}&=&\frac{980\eN \cdot 0.5\emm}{1\emm}\\
&=&490\eN
\end{eqnarray*}

The mechanical advantage is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{mechanical~advantage}&=&\frac{\mathrm{load}}{\mathrm{effort}}\\
&=&\frac{980\eN}{490\eN}\\
&=&2
\end{eqnarray*}

Since mechanical advantage is a ratio, it does not have any units.

\Extension{Pulleys}{Pulleys change the direction of a tension force on a flexible material, e.g. a rope or cable. In addition, pulleys can be ``added together'' to create mechanical advantage, by having the flexible material looped over several pulleys in turn. More loops and pulleys increases the mechanical advantage.}

\subsection{Classes of levers}

{\bf{Class 1 levers}}\\
In a class 1 lever the fulcrum is between the effort and the load. Examples of class 1 levers are the seesaw, crowbar and equal-arm balance. The mechanical advantage of a class 1 lever can be increased by moving the fulcrum closer to the load.

\begin{description}
\item[Newton's First Law] Every object will remain at rest or in
uniform motion in a straight line unless it is made to change its
state by the action of an \emph{unbalanced force}.
\item[Newton's Second Law] The resultant force acting on a body
will cause the body to accelerate in the direction of the
resultant force The acceleration of the body is directly proportional to the magnitude of
the resultant force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
\item[Newton's Third Law] If body A exerts a force on body B then body B
will exert an equal but opposite force on body A.
\item[Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation] Every body in the universe exerts a force on every other body. The force is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the bodies and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
\item[Equilibrium] Objects at rest or moving with constant velocity
are in {\em equilibrium} and have a {\em zero} {\em resultant force}.
\item[Equilibrant] The {\em equilibrant} of any number of forces is
the single force required to produce equilibrium.
\item[Triangle Law for Forces in Equilibrium] Three forces in
equilibrium can be represented in magnitude and direction by the
three sides of a triangle taken in order.
\item[Momentum] The {\em momentum} of an object is defined as its
mass multiplied by its velocity.
\item[Momentum of a System] The {\em total momentum of a system}
is the sum of the momenta of each of the objects in the system.
\item[Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum:] `The total linear
momentum of an isolated system is constant' or `In an isolated
system the total momentum before a collision (or explosion) is equal
to the total momentum after the collision (or explosion)'.
\item[Law of Momentum:] The applied resultant force acting on an
object is equal to the rate of change of the object's momentum and
this force is in the direction of the change in momentum.
