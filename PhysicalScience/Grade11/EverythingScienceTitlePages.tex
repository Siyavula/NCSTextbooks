{ \Large
When we look outside at everything in nature, look around us at everything manufactured or look up at everything in space we cannot but be struck by the incredible diversity and complexity of life; so many things, that look so different, operating in such unique ways. The physical universe really contains incredible complexity.\par

Yet, what is even more remarkable than this seeming complexity is the fact that things in the physical universe are knowable. We can investigate them, analyse them and understand them. It is this ability to understand the physical universe that allows us to transform elements and make technological progress possible.\par

If we look back at some of the things that developed over the last century – space travel, advances in medicine, wireless communication (from television to mobile phones) and materials a thousand times stronger than steel – we see they are not the consequence of magic or some inexplicable phenomena. They were all developed through the study and systematic application of the physical sciences. So as we look forward at the 21st century and some of the problems of poverty, disease and pollution that face us, it is partly to the physical sciences we need to turn. \par

For however great these challenges seem, we know that the physical universe is knowable and that the dedicated study thereof can lead to the most remarkable advances. There can hardly be a more exciting challenge than laying bare the seeming complexity of the physical universe and working with the incredible diversity therein to develop products and services that add real quality to people’s lives.\par

Physical sciences is far more wonderful, exciting and beautiful than magic! It is everywhere.

{\Large
\textbf{\textit{Everything Science}} is not just a Science textbook. It has everything you expect from
your regular printed school textbook, but comes with a whole lot more. For a start, you can download or read it
on-line on your mobile phone, computer or iPad, which means you have the convenience of accessing
it wherever you are.\par


We know that some things are hard to explain in words. That is why every chapter comes with video
lessons and explanations which help bring the ideas and concepts to life. Summary presentations at
the end of every chapter offer an overview of the content covered, with key points highlighted for easy
revision.\par


All the exercises inside the book link to a service where you can get more practice, see the full solution
or test your skills level on mobile and PC.\par


We are interested in what you think, wonder about or struggle with as you read through the book and
attempt the exercises. That is why we made it possible for you to use your mobile phone or computer to
digitally pin your question to a page and see what questions and answers other readers pinned up.\par

Have you ever had a question about a specific fact, formula or exercise in your textbook and wished you could just ask someone? Surely someone else in the country must have had the same question at the same place in the textbook.\par 

We invite you to open the textbook on your mobile phone or computer and pin your question at that  exact spot in the textbook using the shortcode. You will be able to see whether it has been asked before and what the given answer to that question is. \par

The short codes at section headings helps you navigate to sections in the book to ask and view questions for that section. The short codes for the exercises lets you look at questions and answers relating to those specific exercises.\par
