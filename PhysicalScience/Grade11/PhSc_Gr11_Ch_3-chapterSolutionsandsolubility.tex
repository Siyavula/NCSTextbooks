\chapter{Solutions and solubility}
\label{chap:solutions}

We are surrounded by different types of solutions in our daily lives. Any solution is made up of a \textbf{solute} and a \textbf{solvent}. A \textbf{solute} is a substance that dissolves in a solvent. In the case of a sodium chloride (NaCl) solution, the sodium chloride crystals are the solute. A \textbf{solvent} is the substance in which the solute dissolves. In the case of the NaCl solution, the solvent would be the water. In most cases, there is always more of the solvent than there is of the solute in a solution.

\Definition{Solutes and solvents}{A \textbf{solute} is a substance that is dissolved in another substance. A solute can be a solid, liquid or gas. A \textbf{solvent} is the liquid that dissolves a solid, liquid, or gaseous solute.}


\section{Types of solutions}
\label{sec:soln:types}

When a solute is mixed with a solvent, a \textit{mixture} is formed, and this may be either \textit{heterogeneous} or \textit{homogeneous}. If you mix sand and water for example, the sand does not dissolve in the water. This is a \textbf{heterogeneous} mixture. (Hetero is Greek for different). When you mix salt and water, the resulting mixture is \textbf{homogeneous} because the solute has dissolved in the solvent. (Homo is Greek for the same). \\

\Definition{Solution}{
A solution is a homogeneous mixture that consists of a solute that has been dissolved in a solvent.
}

A solution then is a homogeneous mixture of a solute and a solvent. Examples of solutions are:

\begin{itemize}
\item{A \textit{solid solute} dissolved in a \textit{liquid solvent} e.g. sodium chloride dissolved in water.}
\item{A \textit{gas solute} dissolved in a \textit{liquid solvent} e.g. carbon dioxide dissolved in water (fizzy drinks) or oxygen dissolved in water (aquatic ecosystems).}
\item{A \textit{liquid solute} dissolved in a \textit{liquid solvent} e.g. ethanol in water.}
\item{A \textit{solid solute} in a \textit{solid solvent} e.g. metal alloys.}
\item{A \textit{gas solute} in a \textit{gas solvent} e.g. the homogeneous mixture of gases in the air that we breathe.}
\end{itemize}

While there are many different types of solutions, most of those we will  be discussing are \textit{liquids}.\\

\section{Forces and solutions}
\label{sec:soln:forces}

An important question to ask is why some solutes dissolve in certain solvents and not in others. The answer lies in understanding the interaction between the intramolecular and intermolecular forces between the solute and solvent particles.

\Activity{Experiment}{Solubility}{

\Aim{To investigate the solubility of solutes in different solvents.}

\Apparatus{

Salt ($\text{NaCl}$), vinegar ($\text{CH}_3\text{CHOOH}$), iodine ($\text{I}_2$) (CAUTION! Iodine stains the skin.) , ethanol ($\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH}$)}

\Method{

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Mix half a teaspoon of salt in 100 cm$^{3}$ of water}
\item{Mix half a teaspoon of vinegar (acetic acid) in 100 cm$^{3}$ of water}
\item{Mix a few grains of iodine in ethanol}
\item{Mix a few grains of iodine in 100 cm$^{3}$ of water\\}
\end{enumerate}
}

\Results{

Record your observations in the table below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{1.3cm}|p{3cm}|p{1.3cm}|p{3cm}|p{3cm}|}\hline
\textbf{Solute} & \textbf{Polar, non-polar or ionic solute} & \textbf{Solvent} & \textbf{Polar, non-polar or ionic solvent} & \textbf{Does solute dissolve?}\\\hline
Iodine & & Ethanol & & \\\hline
Iodine & & Water & & \\\hline
Vinegar & & Water & & \\\hline
Salt & & Water & & \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

You should have noticed that in some cases, the solute dissolves in the solvent, while in other cases it does not.
}

\Conclusions{

In general, polar and ionic solutes dissolve well in polar solvents, while non-polar solutes dissolve well in non-polar solvents. An easy way to remember this is that 'like dissolves like', in other words, if the solute and the solvent have similar intermolecular forces, there is a high possibility that dissolution will occur. This will be explained in more detail below.
}
}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Non-polar solutes and non-polar solvents} (e.g. iodine and ether)

Iodine molecules are non-polar, and the forces between the molecules are weak van der Waals forces. There are also weak van der Waals forces between ether molecules. Because the intermolecular forces in both the solute and the solvent are similar, it is easy for these to be broken in the solute, allowing the solute to move into the spaces between the molecules of the solvent. The solute dissolves in the solvent.\\}

\item{\textbf{Polar and ionic solutes and polar solvents} (e.g. salt and water})

There are strong electrostatic forces between the ions of a salt such as sodium chloride. There are also strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Because the strength of the intermolecular forces in the solute and solvent are similar, the solute will dissolve in the solvent.
\end{itemize}

\section{Solubility}
\label{sec:soln:solubility}

You may have noticed sometimes that, if you try to dissolve sodium chloride (or some other solute) in a small amount of water, it will initially dissolve, but then appears not to be able to dissolve any further when you keep adding more solute to the solvent. This is called the \textbf{solubility} of the solution. Solubility refers to the maximum amount of solute that will dissolve in a solvent under certain conditions.

\Definition{Solubility}{
Solubility is the ability of a given substance, the solute, to dissolve in a solvent. If a substance has a high solubility, it means that lots of the solute is able to dissolve in the solvent.
}

So what factors affect solubility? Below are some of the factors that affect solubility:

\begin{itemize}
\item{the quantity of solute and solvent in the solution}
\item{the temperature of the solution}
\item{other compounds in the solvent affect solubility because they take up some of the spaces between molecules of the solvent, that could otherwise be taken by the solute itself}
\item{the strength of the forces between particles of the solute, and the strength of forces between particles of the solvent}
\end{itemize}

\Activity{Experiment}{Factors affecting solubility\\}{

\Aim{To determine the effect of temperature on solubility}

\Method{

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Measure 100 cm$^{3}$ of water into a beaker}
\item{Measure 100 g of sodium chloride and place into another beaker}
\item{Slowly pour the sodium chloride into the beaker with the water, stirring it as you add. Keep adding sodium chloride until you notice that the sodium chloride is not dissolving anymore. }
\item{Record the amount of sodium chloride that has been added to the water and the temperature of the solution.}
\item{Now increase the temperature of the water by heating it over a Bunsen burner.}
\item{Repeat the steps above so that you obtain the solubility limit of salt at this higher temperature.}
\item{Continue to increase the temperature as many times as possible and record your results.\\}
\end{enumerate}
}

\Results{

Record your results in the table below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{2.5cm}|p{5cm}|}\hline
\textbf{Temp} ($^{\text}$C) & \textbf{Amount of solute that dissolves in 100 cm$^{3}$ of water} (g) \\\hline
&  \\\hline
&  \\\hline
&  \\\hline
&  \\\hline
&  \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

As you increase the temperature of the water, are you able to dissolve \textit{more} or \textit{less} sodium chloride?
}

\Conclusions{

As the temperature of the solution increases, so does the amount of sodium chloride that will dissolve. The solubility of sodium chloride increases as the temperature increases.}
